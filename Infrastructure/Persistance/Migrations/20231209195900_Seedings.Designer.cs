It can be hard to know whether a poorly child has a cold or something else such as tonsillitis - an inflammation of the tonsils. So what are the signs of tonsillitis, and how can you treat it in your child?</p>\r\n<h2>What is tonsillitis?</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://patient.info/ears-nose-throat-mouth/sore-throat-2/tonsillitis\">Tonsillitis</a>&nbsp;is an inflammation of the tonsils and it's common in children, although adults and teenagers can get it too. It is normally caused by a virus, which spreads when we&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/chest-lungs/cough-leaflet\">cough</a>, sneeze, speak or are in physical contact with others. Sometimes, tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>What are the symptoms of tonsillitis in children?</h2>\r\n<p>Tonsillitis can feel like a bad&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/news-and-features/difference-between-cold-and-flu\">cold</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/infections/influenza-and-flu-like-illness\">flu</a>, but the tonsils at the back of the throat - the two round lumps - will be red and swollen. The main symptoms in children and adults are a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/ears-nose-throat-mouth/sore-throat-2\">sore throat</a>, difficulty swallowing, a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/childrens-health/fever-in-children-high-temperature\">temperature</a>&nbsp;of 38C or higher, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/chest-lungs/cough-leaflet\">cough</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/news-and-features/surprising-causes-of-headaches\">headaches</a>, feeling sick,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/ears-nose-throat-mouth/earache-ear-pain\">earache</a>&nbsp;and feeling tired.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes, the symptoms can be more severe - such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/oedema-swelling\">swollen</a>&nbsp;glands in your neck or blisters on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/news-and-features/what-do-tonsils-do\">tonsils</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>How to treat a child with tonsillitis?</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://patient.info/news-and-features/tonsillitis-treatment\">Tonsillitis</a>&nbsp;usually gets better on its own after a few days, but there are things you can do to help manage the symptoms and keep your child more comfortable.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Make sure they get plenty of rest and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/news-and-features/why-do-we-need-sleep\">sleep</a>.</li>\r\n<li>Ensure your child drinks plenty of water, which can soothe the throat and prevent dehydration.</li>\r\n<li>Encourage your child to eat soft foods, such as soups, yoghurts or mashed potatoes and cooked vegetables, which can be easier to swallow if they have a sore throat.</li>\r\n<li>You can give your child paracetamol-based medicines, such as Calpol, which can reduce a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/fever\">fever</a>&nbsp;and ease pain. You can also give them children&rsquo;s ibuprofen. It&rsquo;s important to make sure you are giving your child the correct dosage for their age or weight.</li>\r\n<li>Throat sprays may help ease sore throats, but they may not be suitable for younger children - speak to your local pharmacist about which ones that may be more suitable for your child.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>When to speak to your doctor if your child has tonsillitis</h2>\r\n<p>If your child&rsquo;s symptoms remain after four days or your child becomes more unwell, you should see your GP. You should also see your doctor if your child has pus-filled spots on their tonsils.</p>\r\n<p>Complications caused by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/ears-nose-throat-mouth/sore-throat-2/tonsillitis\">tonsillitis</a>&nbsp;are very rare but include the development of an abcess called a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/ears-nose-throat-mouth/sore-throat-2/tonsillitis\">quinsy</a>&nbsp;- a fluid-filled blister in the throat - which can make it difficult to breathe. It's important to see your doctor or go to A&amp;E if your child has difficulty breathing.</p>\r\n<p>Most children get tonsillitis which is caused by a virus, but sometimes, it can be caused by bacteria. If this is the case, they may prescribe&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/infections/antibiotics-leaflet\">antibiotics</a>. If your child is prescribed antibiotics, it's important that they finish the full course of the medication.</p>",

But can stress also be a cause, triggering the problem in the first place?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the last decade, Alice Lang, 24, has struggled with severe&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/skin-conditions/acne-leaflet\">acne</a>. The condition, which as a teenager didn't really set her apart, took centre stage in her life when it persisted into adulthood, causing her a great deal of distress. The frequent breakouts of spots and the stigma attached to acne had a negative impact on her self-worth, often making her feel anxious and powerless as the years went by.</p>\r\n<p>\"Acne has been one of the biggest causes of stress in my life. That may sound shallow to some, but because of the constant influx of pretty, perfect faces on social media and in advertising, I just felt like I wasn't good enough. It made my self-esteem drop to rock bottom, so I wasn't confident in anything I was doing,\" explains Lang, who now seeks to empower others with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://notesbyalice.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a blog on her acne journey.</a></p>\r\n<p>She is not alone. Many people who have severe acne like her, but also people with other skin diseases such as psoriasis, report that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352647517300990\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">low self-esteem and anxiety are part of their daily lives.</a></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">A complex link</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A strong link exists between mental well-being and skin health, going way back to childhood, from the first skin-to-skin contact between mothers and their babies. Healthcare professionals have now established that acne and other skin problems can cause stress and poor mental health. However, this is a complex relationship, and untangling cause and effect is no easy feat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"The link between stress and dermatological conditions is difficult to study in humans. It has been suggested that some skin problems are exacerbated by stress. However, the other way around has also been well established. If patients have serious skin conditions, they will become more stressed,\" Dr Anton Alexandroff, consultant dermatologist and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.britishskinfoundation.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">British Skin Foundation</a>&nbsp;spokesperson, explains.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In a recent Patient survey, 90% of healthcare professionals agreed that stress could&nbsp;exacerbate&nbsp; skin problems. 92% said that skin problems could also make mental health problems such as stress, anxiety and depression worse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This is something that Lang is familiar with. Her acne is severe and persistent, and it wasn't initially caused by stress. Yet, over the years, she has noticed a correlation between her emotional state and the severity of her skin problems.</p>\r\n<p>\"I think the stress of feeling so bad about myself and so worried all the time, increased the severity of my acne. My skin would occasionally clear up, but then I'd get a small spot and worry myself all day that my spots were coming back - and I'd have five new ones the following morning,&rdquo; she says.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What does the research show?</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Research up to now has mostly focused on stress as a result of dermatological problems, rather than as a cause. In particular, scientists have investigated some of the most common dermatological conditions such as acne, eczema, alopecia, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/skin-conditions/psoriasis-leaflet\">psoriasis</a>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"It's important to note, however, that this group of patients has been more ready than other groups to come forward in terms of communicating. There are 'gaps' in research of other skin conditions which may reveal similar emotional and stressful experiences,\" says Simon Oates, CEO of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindandskin.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Mind &amp; Skin</a>, a charity working to improve patients' quality of life.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But studies investigating the role of stress in triggering skin problems have also emerged over the years. As early as the late 1970s, it was shown that patients with acne reported a worsening of the condition after going through a stressful event. Over the following decades, small questionnaire-based studies have confirmed this, showing that acne can be aggravated during stressful times,<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12873885\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">&nbsp;such as exam periods.</a>&nbsp;The same has been suggested with other conditions such as eczema or, to a lesser degree,<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjd.16116\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">&nbsp;psoriasis.</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The problem is that many of these studies still suffer from limitations, including small sample sizes, and the difficulty of conducting experiments in the lab to evaluate the impact of stress in real life.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The biological mechanisms linking stress and skin conditions also have yet to be clearly explained. But scientists have already established that chronic stress can interfere<a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Recognizing_the_mind-skin_connection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">&nbsp;with the immune system and with the permeability of the skin</a>, making it less efficient at keeping harmful substances out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, there is evidence that stress is associated with the production of certain hormones, or with the secretion of substances that promote inflammation in the body.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline are produced by people when they experience high levels of anxiety. Those can affect the skin and lead to problems,\" says Alexandroff.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How to deal with the stress of skin problems</h2>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Don't be afraid to seek medical help</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Skin problems often go hand in a hand with shame and stigma, especially because these are conditions that are immediately visible. An open relationship with your doctor is the first step to battle the condition and the stress that goes with it. This includes going to see a doctor for the actual condition, but also a mental health professional if the burden of skin problems becomes too much.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"I would advise all patients to be more open in communicating with their doctor. It is also important to understand that there is not always a 'cure' and that recovery of dermatological symptoms can take time to improve. I would also suggest patients enquire about mental health services. Unfortunately, they may have to be patient due to a lack of services and to high demand,\" Oates points out.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Open up to those close to you</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Being transparent to friends and family about how your skin problems are making you feel can be helpful to get some perspective.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Just talking through feelings and discussing acne really helped me - sometimes, you just need someone else to help you see things a little more rationally and remind you that you're much more than your skin,\" says Lang.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Turn to peer support and charities</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are many resources and support groups available online to discuss skin problems and stress. Online communities such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/forums\">Patient.info forums</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.psoriasis.org/talk-psoriasis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Talk Psoriasis Support Community</a>&nbsp;are good examples of platforms which can inspire patients to share their stories, and to boost each other's well-being by connecting, exchanging information, and meeting new friends.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Turning to charities such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.changingfaces.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Changing Faces</a>, which are doing a lot to raise awareness and to fight stigma, and joining their campaigns, can also be a good option. Interesting resources can also be found on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bad.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">British Association of Dermatologists&rsquo; website&nbsp;</a>and on Mind &amp; Skin, with a lot of up-to-date information, from podcasts to articles, to guide patients, including with stress management.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But it's acne awareness which has really increased a lot in recent years, with social media acting as a powerful platform to spread the message. On Instagram and YouTube, there are interesting channels dedicated to talking about acne and the stress it creates. More and more people are posting raw photos of pimples, redness and scars, to show the reality of living with acne, as well as video diaries, testimonials and treatment advice.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Be yourself</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most significant improvements will come from patients realising their worth as individuals, with or without skin problems.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"One of my best tips is to stop obsessing over your face. Looking in the mirror every hour will only tempt you to pick at your skin and obsess over the slightest change, leading to stress. Try not to worry about what people think. What I've come to realise as I've got a little older is that good people who genuinely care about you won't care about your skin problems,\" Lang says.</p>",

However, in reality, they can occur at any age. In fact, about 8 in every 100 heart attacks occur in those under 55, and 1 in 4 heart attacks in women affects an under-60. They are also twice as likely to be fatal in young women compared to young men, often because they are missed until too late.</p>\r\n<h2>A shock to the system</h2>\r\n<p>Hannah Wrigley was just 26 years old when she had a heart attack.</p>\r\n<p>\"My heart attack was completely unexpected. I was cleaning one Tuesday morning, and I started coughing rather dramatically. I suddenly collapsed to the ground with the worst imaginable burning in the centre of my chest and a crushing pain.\" A few hours later Hannah experienced a heavy left arm and a persistent feeling of pressure in her chest as well as feeling intensely nauseated.</p>\r\n<p>When an ambulance arrived, the ECG read 'acute MI (heart attack) in progress'. Despite this, it was not until Hannah underwent an angiogram a number of hours later that doctors agreed about her diagnosis, simply due to her age and lack of risk factors. Delays in treatment, especially in young women whose MIs are not recognised, can significantly affect outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>Hannah has since been found to have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/allergies-blood-immune/blood-clotting-tests/antiphospholipid-syndrome\">antiphospholipid syndrome</a>, a tendency for her blood to clot more than usual. Before the heart attack Hannah was a strict vegan and not overweight but says she was an anxious, highly strung person. The heart attack has made her revaluate and reassess her priorities.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h3>Taking appropriate action</h3>\r\n<p>The heart attack resulted in her making physical changes, including starting to eat oily fish and doing gentle yoga and Pilates. In addition, she reassessed her health behaviours and reduced a stressful lifestyle. \"I had a huge mental shift and reassessed my priorities, reducing levels of stress.\"</p>\r\n<p>She is also on medication to reduce the risk of her blood clotting again in the future and knows the signs and symptoms to look for. These signs include central crushing chest pain, or a heaviness or discomfort that may spread into the left arm, breathlessness, and nausea or grey tinge to your complexion. Importantly, women are less likely to get the 'classic' central crushing chest pain we see people collapsing with in TV soaps. Instead,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/blogs/sarah-says/2016/05/heart-attacks-in-women-the-classic-female-symptom-isn-t-severe-chest-pain\">symptoms in women are often more vague</a>&nbsp;- another possible reason for higher death rates among women. Knowing the signs can save lives.</p>\r\n<h2>Cardiac health in those who are active</h2>\r\n<p>Keeping active is thought to help keep your heart healthy. It is thought that being physically active can decrease your chance of heart disease or stroke by up to 50%, a fantastic incentive for people to get active. Regular exercise can help lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, help control weight and improve your general health and well-being as well.</p>\r\n<p>People who are very physically active (more than five hours of intense exercise a week) may develop an athlete&rsquo;s heart (athletic heart syndrome). This is a normal physiological change in their heart that takes place over time in response to exercise.</p>\r\n<p>The heart becomes enlarged and beats more slowly, pumping more blood each time it beats. No treatment is required for people with athletic heart syndrome and it does not pose any physical threats to the athlete. However, if these signs (slow heartbeat and an enlarged heart) occur in a non-athletic person, they need to be thoroughly investigated.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Sudden cardiac death in athletes</h2>\r\n<p>Sudden cardiac death is a natural unexpected death from a cardiac arrest (the heart stopping), and usually it occurs during exercise. As scary as it is seeing somebody like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/mar/25/muamba-collapse-minute-by-minute\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Fabrice Muamba</a>&nbsp;collapse in the middle of a Premier League football match, it is very rare.</p>\r\n<p>Usually it is caused by either an inherited heart condition or cardiovascular disease (a heart attack) even if the person is physically fit.</p>\r\n<p>It is important to remember that sudden cardiac death is extremely rare, but if you are concerned, please speak to your doctor. This is especially important if you have a family history of cardiac problems or unexplained collapses. Often, there are no preceding symptoms but there does appear to be a link in some athletes who experience fainting or near fainting during exercise. If this is the case or you are concerned please see your doctor for advice.</p>\r\n<p>For nearly all individuals, regular exercise is very beneficial to the health of the heart, resulting in better heart health. However, as illustrated by Hannah&rsquo;s story and those of athletes who suffer sudden cardiac death, heart disease can affect the young as well, so it is important to be aware of the signs and symptoms.</p>",

However, be sure to wash your hands after touching them as they could be passed on to other parts of the body or to other people.</p>\r\n<p>Fordyce Spots are sebaceous glands - they make a thick moisturiser-like substance for the skin but without hairs coming out of them as on other parts of the body - and manifest as small yellowish or white spots on the head or shaft of the penis.</p>\r\n<p>They may appear more alarming, but, again, fret not - up to 95% of adult men have them and they don't generally require any treatment.</p>\r\n<p>A lymphocele - a hard lump that appears after sex or masturbating - can seem even more worrying, not least because it's usually self-inflicted.</p>\r\n<p>No worries; this swelling caused by a temporary blockage of lymph channels that drain away clear lymph fluid (important in immunity) usually goes away in no time at all and won't cause any permanent problems.</p>\r\n<h2>A spot of bother</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://patient.info/sexual-health/chlamydia\">Chlamydia</a>, warts and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/sexual-health/sexually-transmitted-infections-leaflet/gonorrhoea\">gonorrhoea&nbsp;</a>are the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and, of these,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/sexual-health/sexually-transmitted-infections-leaflet/anogenital-warts\">genital warts</a>&nbsp;are the most common in the UK. They look like small fleshy lumps, sometimes with a cauliflower-shaped surface, and appear on their own or in crops.</p>\r\n<p>Genital warts usually disappear on their own in time but you can pass them on to others,via sexual contact so, guys, be responsible and use a condom to prevent transmission. They can also be treated with special creams or paints, or even 'burned' off with a laser/liquid nitrogen - nerve-wracking, sure, but relatively painless.</p>\r\n<p>Long-term, doctors hope that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/childrens-health/immunisation/human-papillomavirus-immunisation-hpv\">human papillomavirus</a>&nbsp;(HPV) vaccination being given to girls will be extended to boys, which will not only reduce cervical cancer rates but also genital warts.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes a crop of painful blisters or red spots can appear on the penis or groin, which could be indicative of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/sexual-health/sexually-transmitted-infections-leaflet/genital-herpes\">genital herpes</a>. Be proactive and seek medical advice as early as you can - doctors will most likely prescribe tablets to reduce the length of the flare and advise about how to prevent passing the herpes simplex virus on.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://patient.info/mens-health/penis-problems/peyronies-disease\">Peyronie's disease</a>&nbsp;describes a hard lump (called a plaque) that develops on one side of the penis shaft, causing it to bend when erect and interfering with penetration or achieving an erection.</p>\r\n<p>Peyronie's can be caused by aggressive sex or masturbation and is often more difficult to treat - shockwave therapy or even an operation are two options.</p>\r\n<p>\"Guys often come to me with pearly penile papules, but more commonly I'm getting more and more young men coming to me with Peyronie's,\" says Dr Anand Patel, a specialist in sexual function. \"This may be related to more aggressive sex and/or masturbating since pornography has been around.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>What types of spots and pimples on the penis can be a sign of something more serious?</h2>\r\n<p>\"Ulcers or lumps - other than pearly penile papules - that won't go away should be checked out,\" advises Patel. \"A single painless ulcer, or chancre, can be the first presentation of early&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/sexual-health/syphilis\">syphilis</a>&nbsp;and will require antibiotics. If you've got a lump (usually on the head of the penis) that's not going away or is getting bigger, please do get it checked out, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/mens-health/penis-problems/penile-cancer\">penile cancer</a>&nbsp;is an uncommon possibility.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>If in doubt, get it checked out</h2>\r\n<p>So guys, if you are worried about spots or pimples on your penis, don't waste time worrying unnecessarily - make an appointment with a GP or sexual health clinic and put your mind at rest.</p>\r\n<p>\"People sometimes avoid getting checked because they're embarrassed, or just hope any problem will go away,\" says O'Sullivan. \"But it's often easier to treat a problem if it's identified early, and if it's something more serious it means you can be referred urgently.</p>\r\n<p>\"And if it isn't anything to worry about, at least then you'll know for sure!\"</p>\r\n<p>Patel concurs: \"If you've read this and you're still not clear, then please go and get checked out either at your GP or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic, where you'll see doctors and nurses who see this sort of problem many times a day!\" he says.</p>\r\n<p>\"The earlier you see us, the sooner we can ease your concerns or get you some treatment.\"</p>",

                            Content = "<h1 class=\"articleHeader__title\">How to find the right treatment for your hay fever</h1>\r\n<p>For many people across the UK, the arrival of spring is a mixed blessing. No sooner have they shaken off the winter gloom, than they're hit with the onset of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/allergies-blood-immune/hay-fever-leaflet\">hay fever</a>&nbsp;season. Characterised by a streaming nose and itchy eyes, the condition can range in severity from annoying to debilitating.</p>\r\n<p>In actuality, 'hay fever season' is a bit of a misnomer - it all depends on what kind of pollen you're allergic to. According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/pollen-forecast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Met Office</a>, tree pollen season classically runs from late March to mid-May, grass pollen season from mid-May to July, and weed pollen season from June until September. (Despite what TS Eliot may have said, the cruellest month will vary from person to person.)</p>\r\n<p>Of course, hay fever is a misery whenever it occurs, with potential to spoil what would otherwise be a blissful day outside.</p>\r\n<p>\"Hay fever is also called allergic rhinitis or seasonal rhinitis,\" says Holly Shaw, nurse advisor at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.allergyuk.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Allergy UK</a>. \"The majority of hay fever sufferers are affected by grass pollen, but there are different types of pollen that can cause hay fever depending on the time of the year.\"</p>\r\n<p>As an atopic (allergic) condition, it is caused by the body's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/allergies-blood-immune/immune-system-diseases\">immune system&nbsp;</a>overreacting to pollen in the air. The condition can affect anyone of any age, often making its first appearance during childhood or the teenage years. Overall, as many as 1 in 5 Brits are affected.</p>\r\n<p>\"Hay fever commonly affects the nasal passages and the eyes, and has symptoms not dissimilar to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/chest-lungs/cough-leaflet/common-cold-upper-respiratory-tract-infections\">common cold</a>, which is often where patients become confused,\" says Shaw. \"But hay fever is more persistent and has an element of itchiness you may not get with a cold.\"</p>\r\n<h2>Start with antihistamines</h2>\r\n<p>For many hay fever sufferers, a first line of defence is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/allergies-blood-immune/allergies/antihistamines\">antihistamines</a>, which work by blocking the action of histamine (one of the compounds involved in allergic reactions). These come as a nasal spray or a tablet and can be picked up from your pharmacy without a prescription.</p>\r\n<p>If your hay fever is mild, it may be enough to take an antihistamine pill as and when you notice symptoms. You could also consider taking them as a preventative measure on days when the pollen count is high.</p>\r\n<p>Although older types of antihistamine (eg, chlorphenamine, hydroxyzine and promethazine) have a reputation for causing drowsiness, the newer antihistamines (eg, cetirizine, loratadine and fexofenadine) typically lack this side effect.</p>\r\n<p>\"The older generation style of antihistamines is not ideal for those who need to be alert for driving, work etc, so daily non-sedating antihistamines are a good choice of treatment,\" says Shaw. \"Community pharmacists are well placed to give advice and further guidance on which preparations would be suitable for an individual.\"</p>\r\n<h2>Talk to your pharmacist</h2>\r\n<p>She strongly recommends talking to a pharmacist first, to help you target the specific area that's a problem and avoid contra-indications with other medicines.</p>\r\n<p>\"For example, you may or may not have itchy watery red eyes, but if you do have that issue then the use of an eye drop may be effective,\" she says. \"If the nose symptoms are a particular problem then the use of a nasal spray containing an antihistamine or steroid may be advised. It's also really important that you're shown how to use your nasal spray or eye drops because the medicine will only be effective if you know how to use it.\"</p>\r\n<p>There are further treatment options too, such as a nasal allergen balm that can be applied to the outside of the nostrils, preventing pollen from entering the airways. You may also be encouraged to try nasal saline douching - ie using a special preparation to rinse out inflamed nasal passages.</p>\r\n<p>\"We're all individuals, and everyone's going to have their own set of circumstances and symptoms,\" says Shaw. \"Hay fever can be mild, moderate or severe, so it's important to treat symptom severity appropriately.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>When to see the GP</h2>\r\n<p>If you find your symptoms getting worse, or they don&rsquo;t respond to pharmacy medicines, it may be worth visiting your GP. In very severe cases, you might be prescribed a short course of steroids or be referred for immunotherapy.</p>\r\n<p>With immunotherapy, small amounts of pollen are introduced to your system, either via an injection or via a tablet that dissolves under your tongue. Over time, you build up resistance to the pollen, greatly reducing the severity of your symptoms.</p>\r\n<p>The catch here is that it takes a very long time to take effect. In a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5479315/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">major study</a>&nbsp;published last year, researchers found that, while the treatment is highly effective, it needs to be given for at least three years in order to have an impact. It isn't suitable for everyone - and it certainly isn't suitable as a short-term fix.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Other strategies</h2>\r\n<p>In terms of natural remedies for hay fever, the jury's out on whether they actually make a difference. Many people swear by a spoonful of honey (although there's no clinical evidence to support its use), while others gravitate towards a range of herbs and supplements.</p>\r\n<p>Some of these remedies may prove beneficial - for instance,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.allergologyinternational.com/article/S1323-8930(14)00010-0/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">fish oil might have a protective effect</a>&nbsp;against inflammatory conditions like hay fever, and it has been suggested that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2117278/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">eating a Mediterranean diet may reduce allergic symptoms</a>. (Of course, a generally healthy diet is never a bad idea, irrespective of whether it helps your hay fever.)</p>\r\n<p>Less contentious are the lifestyle changes you can make to minimise your exposure to pollen. Through monitoring the pollen forecasts, you can make an informed decision about when to go outside and what kind of preventative measures to take.</p>\r\n<p>\"If you know the pollen count's going to be high next week, you could start using your treatments early, to build up a preventative effect,\" says Shaw. \"Pollen is at its highest early in the morning and late in the evening, so you may want to avoid going outside during those times.\"</p>\r\n<p>For instance, if you enjoy running in the park, you might want to give that a miss on high pollen count days, and go to the gym instead. It's also wise to avoid alcohol (as many drinks contain histamine) and to cover up your eyes and hair - for instance, by wearing hats and wraparound sunglasses.</p>\r\n<p>\"It's important to have a shower or wash your face when you come in from outside, so as not to transfer pollen on to bedding,\" adds Shaw. \"Other sensible measures include closing windows and doors and fitting a pollen filter in your car.\"</p>\r\n<p>The main thing is to know your own body and your own triggers. That way, your local pharmacist (or perhaps your GP) can point you in the direction of a treatment that's right for you.</p>",

There's no guaranteed cure; while in some cases it settles on its own, it's usually treated with medication or surgery. However, some women claim that adopting an endometriosis diet by eating or avoiding certain foods can help reduce endometriosis symptoms. So what's the truth?</p>\r\n<h2>Can endometriosis be cured by diet?</h2>\r\n<p>If you suffer from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/womens-health/pelvic-pain-in-women/endometriosis\">endometriosis</a>, a condition that can cause agonisingly painful periods and difficulty getting pregnant, it's understandable to wonder if changing your lifestyle or adopting an endometriosis diet could help. Current endometriosis treatments, which include surgery and hormonal medication, can be invasive and have unpleasant side effects. It's no wonder many women with endometriosis pin their hopes on alternative solutions, from acupuncture to avoiding certain foods.</p>\r\n<p>Georgina, 27, from Surrey, was diagnosed with endometriosis six years ago and has had numerous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/treatment-medication/laparoscopy-and-laparoscopic-surgery\">surgeries</a>&nbsp;to help control the condition. She says: \"After my latest surgery, I was told that changing my diet - in particular, giving up dairy products, alcohol and gluten - might help my endometriosis symptoms. But I didn't necessarily want to give up the foods I love if there's no evidence that it would actually help.\"</p>\r\n<p>There are countless blogs online by women who claim their endometriosis symptoms disappeared after changing their diets. Such information can undoubtedly offer hope to those facing devastating pain and infertility - but are these stories too good to be true?</p>\r\n<p>Komal Kumar, senior dietitian at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ivf.org.uk/treatments/lister-fertility-dietetic-clinic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Lister Fertility Clinic</a>, part of HCA UK, cautions that so far the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.viamedica.pl/ginekologia_polska/article/view/47748\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">evidence for a link</a>&nbsp;between certain foods and endometriosis is inconclusive. And even if there is a connection, it's likely diet is only one piece of the puzzle.</p>\r\n<p>\"It's only recently research has started to show a potential link between endometriosis and diet,\" she explains. \"But it's important to note that such research refers to how diet can play a role in the management of endometriosis symptoms, rather than as a treatment for endometriosis altogether.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Is a low FODMAP good for endometriosis?</h2>\r\n<p>Women with endometriosis who are perhaps most likely to benefit from a dietary change, Kumar reveals, are those who also suffer from digestive conditions such as<a href=\"https://patient.info/digestive-health/irritable-bowel-syndrome-leaflet\">&nbsp;IBS</a>&nbsp;- which can cause abdominal pain, bloating and constipation or diarrhoea.</p>\r\n<p>She points to<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28303579\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">&nbsp;a recent study</a>&nbsp;which found 72% of a group of women who had both endometriosis and IBS reported an improvement in symptoms after trialling a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/news-and-features/fibre-food-and-gut-bacteria\">low FODMAP diet.</a></p>\r\n<p>\"I believe this is a massive breakthrough for women who suffer with other conditions related to their endometriosis, as through dietary management women have the opportunity to greatly improve their quality of life and reduce the burden of their conditions.\"</p>\r\n<h2>What are the downsides of diet changes</h2>\r\n<p>Saying that, Kumar acknowledges that the low FODMAP diet is very restrictive. She certainly wouldn't advise every woman with endometriosis to start following it.</p>\r\n<p>\"It's vital that if someone with endometriosis is looking to make dietary changes, they seek the expert opinion of a qualified dietitian first, who can provide the latest credible evidence-based information. Without this, the patient could be at risk of developing nutritional deficiencies and other negative side effects such as rapid weight loss or gain.\"</p>\r\n<p>This is particularly important for women who are trying to conceive, she explains. If you're&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/pregnancy/planning-to-become-pregnant\">planning a pregnancy&nbsp;</a>and looking to change to an endometriosis diet, approach the change cautiously and ensure you're getting the nutrients you need before and after conception.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Does going gluten-free help with endometriosis symptoms?</h2>\r\n<p>Some women claim their symptoms of improve on a gluten-free diet. But should Georgina follow suit? Kumar says not necessarily.</p>\r\n<p>She confirms that some women have found their endometriosis symptoms improve when they cut out certain foods, but what works for one woman, won't work for everyone.</p>\r\n<p>There&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23334113\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">was a study</a>&nbsp;conducted on patients with severe endometriosis in 2012, which found 75% of participants noticed an improvement on a year-long gluten-free diet. But the study itself only followed a small amount of women. More research is needed before we know if giving up wheat is truly beneficial in this scenario.</p>\r\n<p>\"There is no specific diet for endometriosis management, and it is impossible to say what women should restrict or should include with their diet as everyone is different,\" Kumar stresses. \"It is so important not to restrict certain food groups or nutrients, such as gluten, unless you have been medically diagnosed as having an intolerance or condition such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/digestive-health/coeliac-disease-leaflet\">coeliac disease</a>, as this can deprive the body of vital nutrients.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>How to eat well with endometriosis</h2>\r\n<p>For most women with endometriosis, Kumar says the best bet is simply to follow a healthy, balanced diet. She points to Public Health England's Eatwell Guide - a resource which shows how much of what we eat overall should come from each food group. You can find more tips on following this method in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/healthy-living/healthy-eating\">healthy eating leaflet</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\"This is based on consuming a balanced diet of carbohydrates, fats and proteins, with women aiming for 2,000 calories per day, unless they are specifically looking to gain or lose weight under the close guidance of a dietician.\"</p>\r\n<p>And remember, while eating certain foods won't necessarily improve endometriosis, it never hurts to eat healthily. Plus, a nutritious diet is also important for preventing potential future health issues such as obesity,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/heart-health/high-blood-pressure-hypertension\">high blood pressure</a>, type 2 diabetes and heart disease.</p>\r\n<p>For women looking to conceive, it's advised to take 400 mg of folic acid per day, Kumar explains. And consuming foods rich in folate - such as spinach, kale and broccoli - is also a good idea.<br /><br />\"Following a good nutrition plan can help to regulate ovulation cycles affected by weight, improve the health of a woman's eggs, improve the success of assisted reproduction therapies such as IVF treatment, and improve chances of bringing a healthy baby to full term,\" she adds.</p>",

A bit of rest, plenty of fluids, taking paracetamol and perhaps a little honey and lemon are usually all it takes to see off a cold - without a visit to the GP.</p>\r\n<p>But if a cough lingers for longer than usual, or we feel particularly unwell, we may start to wonder if we've developed a chest infection. Unlike colds,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/chest-infection\">chest infections</a>&nbsp;may need additional treatment, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/antibiotics-leaflet\">antibiotics</a>&nbsp;in the case of bacterial infections such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/pneumonia-leaflet\">pneumonia</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>I've been coughing for weeks</h2>\r\n<p>Whilst a persistent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/cough-leaflet\">cough</a>&nbsp;can be troublesome, having symptoms that last over two weeks - and even coughing up mucus - does not necessarily indicate a problem. \"Viral coughs can last up to three weeks,\" explains GP&nbsp;<a href=\"http://uberhealthblog.com/about-julie-coffey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Dr Julie Coffey</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\"Many people think if you cough up a little bit of mucus you've got an infection, but this is not necessarily the case,\" explains Coffey. \"But during a common cold the larger tubes in the airways become inflamed, and they produce more mucus than normal. Coughing up mucus that is clear, yellow or even green can be a normal part of a viral cough.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h3>Warning signs</h3>\r\n<p>If you are coughing up more mucus than you have with previous coughs, or are suffering&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/chest-pain-leaflet\">chest pain</a>&nbsp;as a result of persistent coughing, it may be time to see your GP.</p>\r\n<p>\"With a chest infection, you cough much more mucus up,\" agrees Coffey. \"With a bacterial infection, this can be yellow, green, or a darker colour.\" If you cough up blood or rusty-coloured sputum, you should definitely see a doctor.</p>\r\n<p>\"Patents may also experience chest pain, difficulty breathing or a rapid heart-rate.\"</p>\r\n<h2>I have a fever</h2>\r\n<p>Feeling hot?&nbsp; Having a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/fever-and-night-sweats-leaflet\">fever</a>&nbsp;can be a normal part of having a cold and is not necessarily a sign of an infection. However, if you're working up a sweat, it's definitely worth taking and recording your temperature regularly.</p>\r\n<h3>Warning signs</h3>\r\n<p>\"With a viral cough, you often have a fever which tends to go up and down,\" explains Coffey. \"With a bacterial infection, such as pneumonia, you tend to have a consistently high fever - usually around 38-40&deg;C.\"</p>\r\n<p>If your fever remains persistently high, it's worth giving your GP a call.</p>\r\n<h2>I feel terrible!</h2>\r\n<p>Common colds can vary in their severity; whilst sometimes we can struggle on, a bad dose might see us stretched out on the sofa for a couple of days. If we feel particularly bad, we may start to worry that something is wrong.</p>\r\n<p>\"Of course, you will feel unwell with a cold - but not seriously unwell. If you have a chest infection, you'll feel significantly worse than you have in the past,\" explains Coffey.</p>\r\n<h3>Warning signs</h3>\r\n<p>\"Patients who come to see me with an infection often know there's something wrong with them, as they feel much worse than they have with previous coughs and colds.\"</p>\r\n<p>As well as feeling dreadful, patients with chest infection can feel \"a bit drowsy, almost confused in their thinking,\" explains Coffey. \"These symptoms would set alarm bells ringing.\"</p>\r\n<h2>I look dreadful!</h2>\r\n<p>A red nose, cold sores, chapped lips and a pale complexion often accompany a cold - and nobody looks their best when they've been up all night coughing. So can looking ill really be a sign that we need to see our GP?</p>\r\n<h3>Warning signs</h3>\r\n<p>\"Doctors can often tell when a patient has pneumonia when they see you in the waiting room,\" explains Coffey. \"You tend to look more unwell than you have before - the difference is often quite stark. Those around you will also be able to see how unwell you are.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"If you have a bluish tinge to your lips or extremities, this can also be a concern.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>I'm in pain</h2>\r\n<p>Coughs and colds are often accompanied by headaches, sore throats and feelings of general malaise. \"With a cold, or a flu-like illness, you can experience muscle aches,\" explains Dr Kenny Livingstone, GP and founder of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.zoomdoc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ZoomDoc</a>. \"These can usually be managed with paracetamol.\"</p>\r\n<p>However, pain can also be a sign that we&rsquo;ve developed a chest infection, so how can we tell the difference?</p>\r\n<h3>Warning signs</h3>\r\n<p>\"Although we suffer aches and pains as part of a cold, if the pain is severe or you are out of breath, this may be a sign that something is wrong,\" explains Coffey.</p>\r\n<p>\"Patients with a chest infection will often present with chest pain,\" says Livingstone. \"This can also be accompanied by a feeling of 'tightness' or shortness of breath.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Am I at risk?</h2>\r\n<p>Whilst coughs and colds abound, particularly during the winter months, the chances of a fit and healthy person contracting a chest infection are minimal. \"Generally, if you are a reasonably healthy person with no pre-existing problems, the chances are it will be a normal cough. For these, you don't need to visit your doctor or take antibiotics,\" says Coffey.</p>\r\n<p>However, there are certain groups who are at greater risk. \"If you have a weakened immune system, are very young, elderly or seriously overweight, you have an increased risk of pneumonia,\" explains Coffey. People with long-term lung conditions, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/chest-lungs/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-leaflet\">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a>&nbsp;(COPD)<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-leaflet\">,</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/chest-lungs/asthma-leaflet\">asthma</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/chest-lungs/bronchiectasis-leaflet\">bronchiectasis</a>, are at particular risk of problems.</p>\r\n<p>Those who have compromised&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/immune-suppression/immune-system\">immunity</a>&nbsp;should take up the offer of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/medicine/influenza-vaccine\">flu vaccine</a>, to reduce their risk of infection. \"A chest infection often starts with a flu-like illness,\" explains Livingstone. \"The flu vaccine targets the most likely virus strain. So, if you reduce your risk of getting flu, you'll reduce your risk of a chest infection.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"If you're pregnant, or in an at-risk group, it's a good idea to have the vaccine.\"</p>\r\n<h2>I think I have a chest infection - what should I do?</h2>\r\n<p>Coffey recommends that the first port of call should always be your GP, even when symptoms are severe. \"I'd always try the GP in the first instance,\" she says. \"If you explain the symptoms fully to a receptionist, you should get through fairly quickly.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Even if hospitalisation is needed, your GP will be able to help to get you seen more speedily on arrival.\"</p>\r\n<p>Depending on the type and severity of your chest infection, and your overall general health, your GP will often prescribe antibiotics. \"In the case of a bacterial infection, we'd usually give 5-7 days of antibiotics for a patient who was previously fit and well,\" explains Coffey. \"Someone with lung disease might be given 10-14 days.\"</p>\r\n<p>In the case of a viral chest infection, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/acute-bronchitis\">bronchitis</a>, antibiotics are not usually prescribed if a patient was in previously good health.</p>\r\n<p>\"Those with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/asthma-leaflet\">asthma</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-leaflet\">COPD</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/cystic-fibrosis-leaflet\">cystic fibrosis</a>&nbsp;will often need antibiotics and steroid inhalers and sometimes nebulisers,\" adds Livingstone.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Where can I get advice?</h2>\r\n<p>If you want some general advice, or are unsure about your symptoms the first port of call could also be a pharmacist. \"Pharmacists are trained to advise you on managing your symptoms,\" says Livingstone. \"They are also used to recognising the signs of chest infection.

That's particularly true when it comes to unexplained medical symptoms, especially if they're a bit embarrassing to discuss.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It's vital to be aware of changes to your body: whether that's a lump that's appeared, changes to your bowel habits, or a bloated tummy that you've experienced for weeks. Don't just ignore them and hope they'll go away.</p>\r\n<p>Because where&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/cancer/cancer\">cancer&nbsp;</a>is concerned, 'going away' is not going to happen. More importantly, the earlier you're diagnosed and treated, the less extreme your treatment is likely to be and the better your chances of long-term survival.</p>\r\n<p>Clare Hyde, health information officer at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Cancer Research UK</a>, says: \"With a long list of possible signs and symptoms it can be hard to remember what might or might not be cancer. That's why we encourage people to know their bodies and what is normal for them. If you do notice a change or something that doesn't seem right - whatever it is - it's important to tell your doctor. It probably won't be cancer but, if it is, catching it early means that treatment is much more likely to be successful, giving you a better chance of beating the disease.\"</p>\r\n<p>Here are some of the signs it's particularly important to let your doctor know about:</p>\r\n<h2>Blood in your poo</h2>\r\n<p>If you've experienced a change in your bowel habit or blood in your poo for more than three weeks, you should see your GP. Looser or more frequent poos are a particular concern. Now, while we all do it, pooing is the last thing most of us want to read about over our breakfast cup of tea. But we ignore possible<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/Cancer-of-the-Bowel.htm\">&nbsp;bowel cancer symptoms</a>&nbsp;at our peril.</p>\r\n<p>If you do have bowel cancer (and it's the second most common cancer killer in the UK), burying your head in the sand is guaranteed not to make it go away. And getting it diagnosed early hugely increases your chance of successful treatment.</p>\r\n<h2>Bloating</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://patient.info/digestive-health/irritable-bowel-syndrome-leaflet/wind-gas-and-bloating\">Bloating</a>&nbsp;is a common but annoying symptom that usually goes away by itself. We're talking here about persistent bloating - not the kind that comes on after a big meal and settles in an hour or two. If you've been feeling bloated on 12 days or more in the last month, go to your doctor. It's probably nothing serious, but it could be a sign of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/cancer/gynaecological-cancer/ovarian-cancer\">ovarian cancer</a>. It could also be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/digestive-health/irritable-bowel-syndrome-leaflet\">IBS</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/womens-health/periods-and-period-problems/premenstrual-syndrome\">premenstrual syndrome</a>, but don't self-diagnose.</p>\r\n<p>Annwen Jones, chief executive of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.targetovariancancer.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Target Ovarian Cancer</a>, says: \"The symptoms of ovarian cancer include persistent bloating, always feeling full, tummy pain, and needing to wee more.

It's unlikely to be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/cancer/breast-cancer-leaflet\">breast cancer&nbsp;</a>- there are many other causes of breast lumps - but it's always worth getting checked out.</p>\r\n<p>\"There's no right or wrong way to check your breasts - it's about looking and feeling regularly so any changes can be spotted quickly. The sooner breast cancer is diagnosed, the more effective treatment may be,\" says Samia al Qadhi, chief executive of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Breast Cancer Care</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\"Being aware of all the signs and symptoms of breast cancer is crucial - it's not just a lump to look out for. Other changes could be a nipple becoming inverted, discharge from one nipple or a change in texture of the skin. While most symptoms won't mean breast cancer, if you notice anything unusual for you get it checked out by your GP.\"</p>\r\n<p>Similarly, men should&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/news-and-features/getting-to-know-your-testicles\">check their testicles</a>&nbsp;regularly. If you notice a change in size or weight of a testicle, or any swelling or tender spots, see your doctor. Doctors are used to examining breasts and genitals. So don't be embarrassed. They've honestly seen it all before.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Bleeding after menopause</h2>\r\n<p>Bleeding from anywhere is scary, and vaginal bleeding once you thought 'that sort of thing' had stopped for good can be especially worrying. In fact, there's a good chance your doctor can reassure you - but you do need to get it checked out.</p>\r\n<p>Doctors call postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) any bleeding more than 12 months after a woman's last period if she is over the age of about 50. If you're taking&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt\">hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</a>&nbsp;you may get regular periods, but check with your GP if you get significant bleeding more than four weeks after you stop HRT.</p>\r\n<p>Every woman worries&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/what-is-cancer\">about cancer</a>, but about 90% who have PMB can be reassured on testing that there's no sinister cause. Your doctor will need to rule out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/uterine-endometrial-cancer\">cancer of the womb lining</a>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/cervical-cancer-leaflet\">cancer of the cervix</a>. Some women have a polyp - a small, non-cancerous growth from the womb lining. Many others get PMB because of inflammation of the vaginal lining, caused by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/womens-health/menopause/vaginal-dryness-atrophic-vaginitis\">vaginal dryness</a>&nbsp;after the menopause.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Persistent heartburn</h2>\r\n<p>Most people who suffer heartburn, bloating, feeling sick and/or an acid taste in the back of the throat have simple&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/acid-reflux-and-oesophagitis\">inflammation of the oesophagus (oesophagitis</a>) to blame for their discomfort. Likewise, burning pain in the top of your stomach in the middle, sometimes associated with bloating, nausea and wind, is most commonly down to inflammation of the stomach lining, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/dyspepsia-indigestion\">gastritis</a>.</p>\r\n<p>But if these symptoms are associated with vomiting after eating, food sticking as you try to swallow it, weight loss, pain in the front or back of the chest as you swallow, or loss of appetite, it's essential to rule out a more sinister cause.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://patient.info/health/oesophageal-cancer-leaflet\">Cancer of the oesophagus</a>&nbsp;affects just over 8,000 people a year in the UK and most of them are over 50.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/stomach-gastric-cancer\">Stomach cancer</a>&nbsp;is less common in the UK than in some other countries. But the number of people affected is rising. Getting a diagnosis and treatment early can make all the difference to your chances of long-term survival.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Changes to a mole</h2>\r\n<p>See your doctor if you develop an abnormal patch of skin or a change in appearance of a mole to rule out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/cancer/skin-cancer-types\">skin cancer</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Get to know your body and look of the normal moles or marks so that you will know if there has been any change. In particular, if you notice any change in the size, shape or colour of an existing mole, or if a new dark area of skin develops, see your doctor.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Unexplained weight loss</h2>\r\n<p>In most cancer cases, other symptoms will be apparent before any weight loss occurs. But occasionally&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/weight-loss-unintentional\">unintentional weight loss&nbsp;</a>is the first symptom patients notice of multiple types of cancer.</p>\r\n<p>Besides cancer, if you've lost a significant amount of weight without meaning to, you should see your doctor who might test you for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/diabetes/type-2-diabetes\">type 2 diabetes</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/mental-health/depression-leaflet\">depression</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/hormones/overactive-thyroid-gland-hyperthyroidism\">hyperthyroidism</a>.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>If you don't get referred</h2>\r\n<p>It's important to remember that if your GP decided you don't need investigating, it will usually be for very good reasons, and they should be happy to explain them to you. If I referred every patient who ever came to see me worried about cancer, I would probably swamp my hospital's entire cancer services single-handedly. I'm often able to reassure patients that their symptoms are due to a minor cause, but that's not always the case. And if I don't hear about your symptoms, that's a conversation we can't have.</p>",

                            Content = "<h1 class=\"articleHeader__title\">Reasons you feel tired all the time</h1>\r\n<p>As health problems go, it's one of the most common out there, and one of the hardest to pin down. Feeling&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/tiredness-fatigue\">tired&nbsp;</a>all the time - which often goes by the acronym&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/doctor/fatigue-and-tatt\">TATT</a>&nbsp;- might simply indicate that you're not getting enough shut-eye. Depending on your particular circumstances, this problem should be easy enough to fix. But if you're feeling truly exhausted, and can't pin it on any obvious cause, the situation might require a bit more attention.</p>\r\n<p>As Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.rcgp.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Royal College of GPs</a>, explains: \"Feeling tired after a long and busy day can affect all of us from time to time and is a natural response to pushing ourselves hard. This can often be rectified by getting a good night's sleep, eating well, and keeping hydrated. But it's important to be aware of the difference between normal tiredness, which is very common, and abnormal fatigue.\"</p>\r\n<p>If you have the kind of tiredness that doesn&rsquo;t go away, even after a good night's sleep, it may be worth investigating the situation more closely. This is especially the case if you're experiencing other symptoms, have been tired for more than four weeks, or think you might have an underlying condition.</p>\r\n<p>\"If a patient has been experiencing a prolonged lack of energy for no apparent reason, they should seek advice from a healthcare professional,\" says Professor Stokes-Lampard.</p>\r\n<p>Patient's clinical director&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/authors/dr-sarah-jarvis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr Sarah Jarvis&nbsp;</a>agrees. \"Tiredness isn't a disease, it's a symptom - and one we've all suffered at some point. There may be an obvious cause, like jet lag or disturbed nights. But if your tiredness doesn't settle or is affecting your life, it's worth getting it checked,\" she says.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Psychological causes</h2>\r\n<p>Excessive tiredness is something that strikes many of us every once in a while. According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/problemsanddisorders/tiredness.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Royal College of Psychiatrists</a>, one in five people feel unusually tired at any given time, and one in ten have prolonged fatigue.</p>\r\n<p>Often, the causes are psychological, which is not to say the exhaustion is somehow 'all in your head'. Rather, if you're going through a particularly stressful period, be that a house move or a hectic time at work, you'll often feel drained as a result.</p>\r\n<p>For one thing, you may not be sleeping as well as normal. For another, if you're under stress, your body goes into 'fight or flight' mode, sparking up a series of hormonal and physiological changes. If this stress response is activated frequently, you may end up feeling fatigued.</p>\r\n<p>Some alternative medicine practitioners attribute this kind of tiredness to '<a href=\"https://patient.info/hormones/adrenal-fatigue\">adrenal fatigue</a>'&nbsp;- ie an inability to produce the amount of adrenaline you need. This is not a proven medical condition, however, and you should steer clear of remedies that promise to cure it.</p>\r\n<p>Although some life stress is unavoidable, it's particularly important to seek help if you think you may be suffering with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/mental-health/anxiety\">anxiety</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/mental-health/depression-leaflet\">depression</a>&nbsp;or another mental health condition like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/mental-health/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-leaflet\">PTSD</a>. These conditions are often accompanied with fatigue, as well as sleep problems like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/mental-health/insomnia-poor-sleep\">insomnia</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\"Of course there is no simple blood test or scan to diagnose&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/search.asp?searchterm=depression&amp;searchcoll=All\">depression</a>. However, if you've also been feeling down, depressed or hopeless, or haven't been enjoying life as much as you were, depression could lie at the root of your tiredness,\" points out Jarvis.</p>\r\n<p>Some people feel caught in a vicious circle, in which their depression exacerbates their insomnia and their insomnia exacerbates their depression. Although there can be a temptation to self-medicate with alcohol, it's best to steer clear as this can make both problems worse.</p>\r\n<h2>Physical causes</h2>\r\n<p>There can be physical causes for 'TATT' too, although they're less common than the psychological ones.</p>\r\n<p>\"A prolonged state of lethargy can sometimes be a symptom of a serious underlying condition, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/diabetes/type-2-diabetes\">type 2 diabetes</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/digestive-health/coeliac-disease-leaflet\">coeliac disease</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/allergies-blood-immune/anaemia-leaflet\">anaemia</a>,&rdquo; says Stokes-Lampard. \"Patients are rarely fatigued in isolation, and will often experience other symptoms. For example, with respect to coeliac disease, patients might also feel bloated or have diarrhoea, and experience weight loss.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"For type 2 diabetes, along with tiredness, you may feel more thirsty, need to pass urine more often or get more minor infections like boils or recurrent thrush,\" adds Jarvis.</p>\r\n<p>Other issues that can cause fatigue are thyroid problems like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/doctor/hypothyroidism\">hypothyroidism</a>, infections such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/ears-nose-throat-mouth/sore-throat-2/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis\">glandular fever</a>, or sleep disorders like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/tiredness-fatigue/obstructive-sleep-apnoea-syndrome\">sleep apnoea</a>. If your doctor suspects any of these causes, he or she will run a physical test.</p>\r\n<p>Less commonly, you might be suffering with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/tiredness-fatigue/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-myalgic-encephalomyelitis\">chronic fatigue syndrome</a>, also known as ME, which is characterised by extreme tiredness along with symptoms such as foggy-headedness and muscle pain. Unfortunately, there is no specific test to confirm the diagnosis of ME. You'll be diagnosed only when other conditions are ruled out.</p>\r\n<p>ME can range in severity from relatively mild to extremely disabling. While most people do eventually recover, there is currently no cure, and symptoms may take a relapsing-remitting course. A related condition,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/tiredness-fatigue/fibromyalgia\">fibromyalgia</a>, can also cause chronic fatigue.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond these causes, tiredness can be a side effect of certain medications, and it is to be expected if you're currently pregnant, or have gone through surgery or chemotherapy. You're also more likely to suffer tiredness if you're very overweight (as your body has to work harder day-to-day) or underweight (as your muscles might not be very strong).</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Avoid the sugar crash</h2>\r\n<p>If you don't have an underlying condition that requires treatment, making a few lifestyle changes might be enough. To begin with, it's worth re-evaluating your diet. Steer clear of refined carbohydrates, as these provide a short-lived energy spike, followed by a crash that leaves you craving your next sugar hit.</p>\r\n<p>As Patient's nutritionist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/authors/rose-constantine-smith\">Rose Constantine Smith</a>&nbsp;explains, it's important that each meal provides a good balance of nutrients.</p>\r\n<p>\"Try to include a portion of lean protein, vegetables and a source of complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, potatoes with skins on or pulses,\" she says. \"These are broken down slowly by the body, thus providing a steady supply of energy to keep you going until your next meal. If, however, you are in need of a pick-me-up between meals, opt for natural sources of quick-release energy alongside a harder-to-digest food that will slow the release of sugar into the bloodstream.\"</p>\r\n<p>A few examples might be dried fruit with nuts; yoghurt with chopped fresh fruit; or a slice of wholegrain toast with a thin layer of peanut butter.</p>\r\n<p>\"Coffee with a splash of milk may also provide a much needed pick-me-up if you are feeling particularly tired, and drinking up to three cups of coffee a day is said to be beneficial. Try to avoid having any in the afternoon though, as this may disrupt your sleep!\" adds Rose.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Exercise and sleep</h2>\r\n<p>As well as tweaking your diet, it's also important to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/healthy-living/physical-activity-for-health\">make sure you're exercising enough</a>. This may be the last thing you feel like doing when you're exhausted, but the benefits speak for themselves. Quite aside from the endorphin hit, regular exercise improves sleep quality and gives you more stamina to get through the day.</p>\r\n<p>A word of warning though - more is not always better. So-called 'overtraining syndrome' is real, and athletes need a lot of rest in order to recover properly. Overtraining typically leads to performance plateaus, a higher risk of injury, and - most saliently - fatigue. If that's you, make sure to scale back on your workouts, or take some time off. (And avoid exercising just before bed, as that much sought-after energy boost can leave you unable to sleep!)</p>\r\n<p>One final tip is to look at your sleep itself. How is your sleep quality? Is it being compromised by, for example, afternoon energy drinks, too much&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/news-and-features/what-binge-watching-is-really-doing-to-your-heath\">screen time</a>&nbsp;before bedtime, excessive alcohol consumption, or naps at odd times? Being a bit stricter about your 'sleep hygiene' can make all the difference when it comes to increasing your energy levels.</p>\r\n<p>Although feeling tired all the time is very common, it isn't exactly 'normal', and it shouldn't be something you have to live with. Make sure to book an appointment with your GP if you've ruled out all the obvious factors and are concerned.</p>",

Most of us immediately think of heart disease when we experience it. The pain can vary from mild to severe, occasional or frequent, and can be felt on either side of the chest as well as the centre. But what causes chest pain and when should you worry?</p>\r\n<h2>Chest pain causes</h2>\r\n<p>Frustratingly for doctors and patients alike, there are a lot of things that can potentially cause chest pain.</p>\r\n<p>Dr Jeff Foster, a GP at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tfjprivategp.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Spire Parkway</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;Solihull, explains: \"<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/chest-pain-leaflet\">Chest pain&nbsp;</a>can be difficult to manage sometimes because it can be caused by several completely different parts of the body: heart, lungs, digestive system, muscles, bones and psychological conditions. Virtually all of these systems can have minor or serious conditions which can make it hard for a doctor to find the cause.\"</p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, most of the time chest pain does not have a serious cause, but it's still important to seek medical advice as soon as possible after experiencing it, explains cardiologist Dr Michael MacDonald.</p>\r\n<p>He reveals that your doctor will consider conditions like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/heart-health/angina-leaflet\">angina</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/chest-infection\">chest infection</a>, digestive conditions like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/acid-reflux-and-oesophagitis\">acid reflux</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/dyspepsia-indigestion/stomach-ulcer-gastric-ulcer\">stomach ulcers,</a><a href=\"https://patient.info/health/gallstones-and-bile\">&nbsp;gallstones</a>, inflammation of tissues around your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/chest-pain-leaflet/costochondritis\">ribs</a>&nbsp;and muscle injuries.</p>\r\n<p>\"The good thing is that most chest pain is not too serious. But it's still important you seek medical advice and let your doctor decide on the diagnosis. If you have any concern it is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/heart-health/heart-attack-myocardial-infarction-leaflet\">heart attack</a>, dial 999 [if in the UK] straightaway,\" he says.</p>\r\n<h2>When it could be serious</h2>\r\n<p>The warning signs of a<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/heart-attack-myocardial-infarction-leaflet\">&nbsp;heart attack,</a>&nbsp;explains McDonald, are: \"A sudden chest pain that may spread to your jaw, neck, arms (usually left), or back. At the same time, you may have pressure, squeezing, heaviness or tightness in your chest,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/breathlessness-and-breathing-difficulties-dyspnoea\">shortness of breath</a>, nausea and sweating. If you have these, [if in the UK] call 999 immediately.\"</p>\r\n<p>Some people's description of a heart attack is that it was \"like an elephant sitting on my chest\".</p>\r\n<h2>Heart attack in women</h2>\r\n<p>In women the symptoms of a heart attack may be less severe and many women seek medical help later than they should.</p>\r\n<p>Foster says: \"There is increasing evidence that the symptoms felt in heart attacks can differ in men and women. Women often still feel a central crushing chest pain radiating to the arm or neck, but some studies suggest that women may report this pain in a different way: as being sharp, or being located in the upper abdomen, or with back pressure. Women may also have common nonspecific symptoms such as extreme fatigue, dizziness, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/dizziness/fainting-collapse\">fainting</a>.\"</p>\r\n<h2>Angina</h2>\r\n<p>Angina is chest pain that comes from the heart. This is a common but potentially serious condition.</p>\r\n<p>There are two types of angina:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Stable angina which occurs during exercise.</li>\r\n<li>Unstable angina which occurs at any time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Foster describes angina as being a 'pre-heart attack' condition.</p>\r\n<p>\"Once the arteries are narrow to a point of nearly being blocked off, occasionally the blood supply to the heart will be compromised enough to cause chest pain which mimics a heart attack. Unstable angina is very close to a full-blown heart attack,\" he reveals.</p>\r\n<h2>How doctors investigate chest pain</h2>\r\n<p>Foster reveals that doctors use the acronym SOCRATES to help them get to the bottom of what's causing a patient's chest pain. Socrates stands for: Site, Onset, Character, Radiation, Associations, Time, Exacerbating factors and Severity.</p>\r\n<h3>Site</h3>\r\n<p>The site of the pain. Is the pain felt on the right, left or centre of your chest? If it's on the left or central, it could be due to a heart problem. If it's felt on the right, it could signal an issue with your lungs or a particular muscle.</p>\r\n<h3>Onset</h3>\r\n<p>How long you have had the pain is an important factor. Has it been there for weeks and it's getting worse (which could be linked to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/mental-health/anxiety\">anxiety</a>) or has it come on suddenly?</p>\r\n<h3>Character</h3>\r\n<p>What type of pain is it? A sharp and stabbing pain could signal lung disease or a nerve problem. While a more burning pain could be due to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/digestive-health/dyspepsia-indigestion\">indigestion</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Radiation</h3>\r\n<p>Where is the pain and does it radiate down the arm? Pain in the left arm can be linked to heart disease, whereas on the right it could be your gallbladder.</p>\r\n<h3>Association</h3>\r\n<p>Does your pain seem associated with anything like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/chest-lungs/cough-leaflet\">coughing&nbsp;</a>or anxiety?</p>\r\n<h3>Time</h3>\r\n<p>How long does the pain last? Is it worse in the morning, evening or after eating?</p>\r\n<h3>Exacerbating factors</h3>\r\n<p>Does anything help, such as over-the-counter medication?</p>\r\n<h3>Severity</h3>\r\n<p>And finally, how severe is it? A scale of 1-10 describes mild pain that comes on gradually, to severe pain.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Don't self-diagnose; see your GP</h2>\r\n<p>It's important not to self-diagnose, but you can prepare for your appointment with your doctor by thinking about these questions.</p>\r\n<p>And whichever type of chest pain you have, it's sensible to have it checked out, especially if it occurs during exercise. Make some notes about when it happens, how often you experience it, and the type of pain it is. If you are in any doubt that it could be a heart attack, if in the UK, call 999 immediately.</p>",
