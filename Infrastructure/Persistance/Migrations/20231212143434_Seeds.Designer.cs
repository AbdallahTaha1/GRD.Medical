Lift Things and Move Around</h2>\r\n<p>Using your muscles is extremely important for optimal health.</p>\r\n<p>While lifting weights and exercising can certainly help you look better, improving your appearance is really just the tip of the iceberg.</p>\r\n<p>You also need to exercise to ensure your body, brain and hormones function optimally.</p>\r\n<p>Lifting weights lowers your blood sugar and insulin levels, improves cholesterol and lowers triglycerides (<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003999305002121\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3</a>).</p>\r\n<p>It also raises your levels of testosterone and growth hormones, both associated with improved well-being (<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15831061\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">4<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, exercise can help reduce depression and your risk of various chronic diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer&rsquo;s and many more (<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2006.00520.x/full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, exercise may help you lose fat, especially in combination with a healthy diet.

You don&rsquo;t need to go to a gym or own expensive workout equipment.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible to exercise for free and in the comfort of your own home. Just do a search on Google or YouTube for &ldquo;bodyweight workouts&rdquo; or &ldquo;calisthenics,&rdquo; for example.</p>\r\n<p>Going outside to hike or take a walk is another important thing you should do, especially if you can get some sun while you&rsquo;re at it (for a natural source of vitamin D). Walking is a good choice and a highly underrated form of exercise.</p>\r\n<p>The key is to choose something that you enjoy and can stick with in the long run.</p>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re completely out of shape or have medical problems, it&rsquo;s a good idea to talk to your doctor or a qualified health professional before starting a new training program.</p>\r\n<h2>3.

Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)</h2>\r\n<div id=\"TOC_TITLE_2\" class=\"content_body\"></div>\r\n<p>Monosodium glutamate, or MSG, is a common food additive used to intensify and enhance the flavor of savory dishes.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s found in a variety of processed foods like frozen dinners, salty snacks and canned soups.

This can partially be attributed to physical changes, such as decreasing levels of estrogen and progesterone. Hot flashes, sweating, and other symptoms of menopause may cause disruptions.</p>\r\n<p>There may also be emotional changes, such as worries about getting older, losing family members, or children leaving home.</p>\r\n<p>For some women, menopause may be a time of isolation or frustration. Family and friends may not always understand what you&rsquo;re going through, or give you the support you need. If you&rsquo;re having trouble coping, it is possible to develop anxiety or depression.</p>\r\n<h2>Recognizing the Symptoms of Depression</h2>\r\n<p>Everyone feels sad once in a while. However, if you regularly feel sad, tearful, hopeless, or empty, you may be experiencing depression. Other symptoms of depression include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>irritability, frustration, or angry outbursts</li>\r\n<li>anxiety, restlessness, or agitation</li>\r\n<li>feelings of guilt or worthlessness</li>\r\n<li>loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy</li>\r\n<li>trouble concentrating or making decisions</li>\r\n<li>lapses in memory</li>\r\n<li>lack of energy</li>\r\n<li>sleeping too little or too much</li>\r\n<li>changes in your appetite</li>\r\n<li>unexplained physical pain</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Understanding the Risks of Depression</h2>\r\n<p>Changing hormone levels during menopause may affect your physical and emotional health. Also, the rapid drop in estrogen may not be the only thing affecting your mood. The following factors may also make developing anxiety or depression during menopause more likely:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>diagnosis with depression prior to menopause</li>\r\n<li>negative feelings toward menopause or the idea of aging</li>\r\n<li>increased stress, either from work or personal relationships</li>\r\n<li>discontent about your work, living environment, or financial situation</li>\r\n<li>low self-esteem or anxiety</li>\r\n<li>not feeling supported by the people around you</li>\r\n<li>lack of exercise or physical activity</li>\r\n<li>smoking</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div id=\"m05f85cbe-c702-4398-8e70-9b4ded01c027mpd_firstQuarter_d0ed7c2e-ac5b-491f-bca7-ba7358166961\" class=\"\" data-testid=\"driver\" data-placement=\"firstQuarter\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"css-1cg0byz\">\r\n<aside class=\"css-0 css-0\" data-testid=\"sticky-inline-ad\" data-sticky=\"false\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"css-9was16\" data-empty=\"true\">\r\n<h2>Treating Depression Through Lifestyle Changes</h2>\r\n<p>Depression during menopause is treated in much the same way it&rsquo;s treated at any other time in life. Your doctor may prescribe lifestyle changes, medications, therapy, or a combination of these options.</p>\r\n<p>Before attributing your depression to menopause, your doctor will first want to rule out any physical reasons for your symptoms, such as thyroid problems.</p>\r\n<p>After making a diagnosis, your doctor may suggest the following lifestyle changes to see if they provide natural relief from your depression or anxiety.</p>\r\n<h3>Get Adequate Sleep</h3>\r\n<p>Many women in menopause experience&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717 sl\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/menopause/sleep-problems\">sleep problems</a>. Your doctor may recommend getting more sleep at night. Try to follow a regular sleep schedule by going to bed at the same time each night and waking up at the same time each morning. Keeping your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool while you sleep may also help.</p>\r\n<h3>Get Regular Exercise</h3>\r\n<p>Regular exercise can help relieve stress, while boosting your energy and mood. Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise a day, five days a week. For example, go for a brisk walk or bike ride, swim laps in a pool, or play a game of tennis.</p>\r\n<p>It is also important to include at least two sessions of muscle-strengthening activities in your weekly routine. Weight lifting, activities with resistance bands, and yoga may be good choices. Be certain to discuss planned exercise routines with your doctor.</p>\r\n<h3>Try Relaxation Techniques</h3>\r\n<p>Yoga, tai chi, meditation, and massage are all relaxing activities that can help reduce stress. They may also have the added benefit of helping you sleep better at night.</p>\r\n<h3>Quit Smoking</h3>\r\n<p>Research suggests that menopausal women who smoke are at a greater risk of developing depression, compared to nonsmokers. If you currently smoke, ask for help quitting. Your doctor can give you information about smoking cessation tools and techniques.</p>\r\n<h3>Seek Support Groups</h3>\r\n<p>Your friends and family members may provide you with valuable social support. However, sometimes it helps to connect with other women in your community who are also going through menopause. Remember, you&rsquo;re not alone. There are others who are also going through this change.</p>\r\n<h2>Treating Depression Through Medications and Therapy</h2>\r\n<p>If lifestyle changes don&rsquo;t bring relief, your doctor may look at other treatment options. For example, hormone replacement therapy, antidepressant medications, or talk therapy may be recommend.</p>\r\n<h3>Low-Dose Estrogen Replacement Therapy</h3>\r\n<p>Your doctor may prescribe estrogen replacement therapy, in the form of an oral pill or skin patch. Research suggests that estrogen replacement therapy may provide relief for both physical and emotional symptoms of menopause. However, estrogen therapy may also increase your risk of breast cancer and blood clots.</p>\r\n<h3>Antidepressant Drug Therapy</h3>\r\n<p>If hormone replacement therapy isn&rsquo;t an option for you, your doctor may prescribe traditional antidepressant medications. These may be used in the short term while you adjust to the changes in your life, or you may need them for a longer period of time.</p>\r\n<h3>Talk Therapy</h3>\r\n<p>Feelings of isolation may prevent you from sharing what you&rsquo;re experiencing with friends or family members. You may find it easier to speak with a trained therapist who can help you cope with the challenges you&rsquo;re experiencing.</p>\r\n<h2>Depression During Menopause Is Treatable</h2>\r\n<p>Depression during menopause is a treatable condition. It&rsquo;s important to remember that there are several treatment options that may help to relieve symptoms and provide strategies for copying with changes. Talk with your doctor to discover what options may be the most effective.</p>\r\n<div id=\"dlb_firstQuarter_mpd__slot\" class=\" css-itezwm\" data-ad=\"true\" data-adbridg-ad-class-ctr=\"1\" data-adbridg-ad-class-loaded=\"dlb_mpd\" data-adbridg-phase=\"detected@5150.9ms;gpt_define@5152.9ms;gpt_render:138323057695@6253.3ms;gpt_view@195984.8ms\" data-google-query-id=\"CMLHp_TlhIMDFQpXGwodqe0BBA\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</aside>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

As long as the number on the scale is dropping, you can tell your diet and exercise plan are working, but what other signs can let you know you&rsquo;re on the right path?</p>\r\n<h2>10 signs you&rsquo;re losing weight</h2>\r\n<p>How can you tell that your health is steadily improving and your weight loss journey is progressing? Here are some factors to indicate that you&rsquo;re moving in a good direction:</p>\r\n<h3>1. You&rsquo;re not hungry all the time</h3>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re losing weight because you changed your diet to include more&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-protein-per-day\">proteins</a>&nbsp;and fewer carbs and fat, you may notice that you feel full faster.</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s because the amino acids in&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/functions-of-protein\">dietary protein</a>&nbsp;send a satisfaction signal to your brain &mdash; and that signal isn&rsquo;t sent by eating the same number of calories in fat or carbs.</p>\r\n<p>Good news here for&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vegan-vs-vegetarian\">vegetarians and vegans</a>: A&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1024/0300-9831/a000059\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2013 study</a>&nbsp;found that the satisfaction signal is stronger with vegetable proteins than with animal-derived proteins.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Your sense of well-being improves</h3>\r\n<p>Losing weight can lead to an all-around improvement in your psychological well-being.</p>\r\n<p>In a&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4733266/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2013 study<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>, people who were trying to lose weight reported that they felt more vitality, more self-control, less depression, and less anxiety than they had felt before their weight loss.</p>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not feeling these emotional benefits yet, don&rsquo;t give up: Study participants didn&rsquo;t report these improvements at the 6-month mark. The big psychological changes showed up at the 12-month interviews.</p>\r\n<p>Another important note: If you&rsquo;re losing weight as an unintentional side effect of trauma, illness, or a big life change such as a divorce or job loss, you might not be experiencing the same emotional upsurge.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Your clothes fit differently</h3>\r\n<p>You may notice that you don&rsquo;t have to jump to pull on your jeans, even before you see a big difference on the scale &mdash; which can motivate you to keep doing what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>\r\n<p>In one&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28885942/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2017 study<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>, around 77 percent of women and 36 percent of men said they&rsquo;re motivated to lose weight to improve the way their clothes fit their bodies.</p>\r\n<h3>4. You&rsquo;re noticing some muscle definition</h3>\r\n<p>It can take some time &mdash; usually weeks or months &mdash; to build strength and see muscle definition. How fast you see changes will depend on your body and the type of exercise you&rsquo;ve incorporated into your plan.</p>\r\n<p>One&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30640303/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2019 study<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;found that young women built more muscle mass in their legs when they performed more repetitions of leg curls and presses with a lighter load than with fewer reps and a heavier load.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to keep building muscle as you lose weight, experts&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5421125/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recommend<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;that you get enough (but not too much) protein and do&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/best-resistance-bands\">resistance</a>-type exercises.</p>\r\n<h3>5. Your body measurements are changing</h3>\r\n<p>A shrinking waist size is good news for your overall health.&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5337678/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Researchers<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;tracked 430 people in a 2-year weight management program and noted that a reduction in waist measurement was associated with improved outcomes in blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol.</p>\r\n<p>Other&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7027970/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">studies<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;have drawn a direct link between your waist circumference and your risk of cardiovascular disease. Whether or not the scale says you&rsquo;re down, a looser waistband means better heart health.</p>\r\n<h3>6. Your chronic pain improves</h3>\r\n<p>Weight loss can help decrease pain, especially in weight-bearing areas of the body, like the lower legs and lower back.</p>\r\n<p>In&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.jpain.org/article/S1526-5900(17)30684-3/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one 2017 study</a>, people who lost at least 10 percent of their body weight noticed the greatest improvement in chronic pain around weight-bearing zones.</p>\r\n<p>In&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29911741/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">another study<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>, losing 20 percent of body weight dramatically improved knee pain and inflammation in people with arthritis.</p>\r\n<h3>7. You&rsquo;re going to the bathroom more &mdash; or less &mdash; frequently</h3>\r\n<p>Changing what you eat may affect your bowel movement patterns.</p>\r\n<p>Eliminating meat and adding more leafy greens and vegetables to your diet can improve constipation, whereas adding more animal protein to your diet (as many paleo and keto diets do) can make some people more prone to constipation.</p>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re concerned about the differences in your bowel movements, or if they&rsquo;re interfering with your productivity, it may be a good idea to talk with a nutritionist or healthcare provider about tweaking your plan to improve your gut health.</p>\r\n<h3>8. Your blood pressure is coming down</h3>\r\n<p>Being overweight can have a negative effect on your&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/high-blood-pressure-hypertension\">blood pressure</a>, making you vulnerable to strokes and heart attacks.</p>\r\n<p>One way to bring down your blood pressure is to lose weight with a healthier diet and more movement. If you&rsquo;re losing weight, you&rsquo;re reducing the strain on your heart and beginning to normalize your blood pressure.</p>\r\n<h3>9. You snore less</h3>\r\n<p>Snoring has a complicated relationship with weight. Researchers have found that people (especially women) who have&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/metabolic-syndrome\">metabolic syndrome</a>&nbsp;(a precursor to diabetes) have a tendency to snore.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, snoring and sleep apnea may even cause weight gain. For that reason, weight loss is often one of the targeted therapies for people who snore and who have sleeping disorders.</p>\r\n<h3>10. Your mood improves</h3>\r\n<p>Making healthy changes to your eating habits can lead to a better mood and more energy.</p>\r\n<p>In a&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5154680/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2016 study<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>, researchers found that a high glycemic load diet consisting of cookies, potatoes, crackers, cakes, and bagels, which tend to cause spikes in blood sugar, led to 38 percent more symptoms of depression and 26 percent more fatigue than a low glycemic load diet.</p>\r\n<p>If your food choices are causing fewer peaks and valleys in your blood sugar, you&rsquo;re probably feeling some of the emotional and psychological benefits that come from weight loss.</p>\r\n<h2>What is healthy weight loss?&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>Healthy weight loss is slow and sustainable. It&rsquo;s based on long-term changes to the way you think, eat, and move. Many doctors advise patients to aim to lose no more than 2 pounds a week.</p>\r\n<h2>What are some signs that you&rsquo;re losing weight too fast?</h2>\r\n<p>Seeing a big weight change in a short period of time may be highly motivational, but losing weight through fad diets or unsustainable practices can cause some unhealthy&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/losing-weight-too-fast\">side effects</a>, such as:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>hair loss</li>\r\n<li>fatigue</li>\r\n<li>slowed metabolism</li>\r\n<li>muscle cramps</li>\r\n<li>gallstones</li>\r\n<li>weakened immune system</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure about the long-term health effects of your weight management plan, talk with a registered dietitian, a licensed nutritionist, or your healthcare provider about it early in your process.</p>",

All calories are equal</h2>\r\n<p>The calorie is a measurement of energy. All&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-many-calories-per-day\">calories</a>&nbsp;have the same energy content.</p>\r\n<p>However, this does not mean that all calorie sources have the same effects on your weight.</p>\r\n<p>Different foods go through different metabolic pathways and can have vastly different effects on hunger and the hormones that regulate your body weight.</p>\r\n<p>For example, a protein calorie is not the same as a fat or carb calorie.</p>\r\n<p>Replacing carbs and fat&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-protein-can-help-you-lose-weight\">with protein</a>&nbsp;can boost your metabolism and reduce appetite and cravings, all while optimizing the function of some weight-regulating hormones (<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25926512\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>,&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4424378/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>,&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4258944/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>\r\n<p>Also, calories from whole foods like&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/is-fruit-good-or-bad-for-your-health\">fruit</a>&nbsp;tend to be much more filling than calories from refined foods, such as candy.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Losing weight is a linear process</h2>\r\n<p>osing weight is usually not a linear process, as some people think.</p>\r\n<p>Some days and weeks you may lose weight, while during others you may gain a little bit.</p>\r\n<p>This is not a cause for concern. It&rsquo;s normal for body weight to fluctuate up and down by a few pounds.</p>\r\n<p>For example, you may be carrying more food in your&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-foods-for-digestion\">digestive system</a>&nbsp;or holding on to more water than usual.</p>\r\n<p>This is even more pronounced in women, as&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/13-ways-to-lose-water-weight\">water weight</a>&nbsp;can fluctuate significantly during the menstrual cycle (<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3154522/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">4<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>\r\n<p>As long as the general trend is going downwards, no matter how much it fluctuates, you will still succeed in losing weight over the long term.</p>\r\n<h2>3. Supplements can help you lose weight</h2>\r\n<p>The weight loss supplement industry is massive.</p>\r\n<p>Various companies claim that their supplements have dramatic effects, but they&rsquo;re rarely very effective when studied.</p>\r\n<p>The main reason that supplements work for some people is the placebo effect. People fall for the marketing tactics and want the supplements to help them lose weight, so they become&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mindful-eating-guide\">more conscious of what they eat</a>.</p>\r\n<p>That said, a few supplements have a modest effect on weight loss. The&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-weight-loss-pills-reviewed\">best ones</a>&nbsp;may help you shed a small amount of weight over several months.</p>\r\n<h2>4. Obesity is about willpower, not biology</h2>\r\n<p>It is inaccurate to say that your weight is all about willpower.</p>\r\n<p>Obesity is a very complex disorder with dozens &mdash; if not hundreds &mdash; of contributing factors.</p>\r\n<p>Numerous genetic variables are associated with obesity, and various medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism, PCOS, and depression, can increase your risk of&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-causes-of-weight-gain\">weight gain</a>&nbsp;(<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17566051\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>\r\n<p>Your body also has numerous hormones and biological pathways that are supposed to regulate body weight. These tend to be dysfunctional in people with obesity, making it much harder to lose weight and keep it off (<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v39/n8/full/ijo201559a.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">6<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>\r\n<p>For example, being resistant to the hormone&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/leptin-101\">leptin</a>&nbsp;is a major cause of obesity (<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25232147\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">7<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>\r\n<p>The leptin signal is supposed to tell your brain that it has enough fat stored. Yet, if you&rsquo;re resistant to leptin, your brain thinks that you&rsquo;re starving.</p>\r\n<p>Trying to exert willpower and consciously eating less in the face of the leptin-driven starvation signal is incredibly difficult.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that people should give up and accept their genetic fate. Losing weight is still possible &mdash; it&rsquo;s just much harder for some people.</p>\r\n<h2>5. Eat less, move more</h2>\r\n<p>Body fat is simply stored energy.</p>\r\n<p>To lose fat, you need to&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/debunking-the-calorie-myth\">burn more calories than you take in</a>.</p>\r\n<p>For this reason, it seems only logical that eating less and moving more would cause weight loss.</p>\r\n<p>While this advice works in theory, especially if you make a permanent lifestyle change, it&rsquo;s a bad recommendation for those with a serious weight problem.</p>\r\n<p>Most people who follow this advice end up regaining any lost weight due to physiological and biochemical factors (<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25896063\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">6<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>\r\n<p>A major and sustained change in perspective and behavior is needed to lose weight with diet and&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise\">exercise</a>. Restricting your food intake and getting more physical activity isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>\r\n<p>Instructing someone with obesity to simply eat less and move more is like telling someone with depression to cheer up or someone with alcoholism to drink less.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Carbs make you fat</h2>\r\n<p><a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/low-carb-diet-meal-plan-and-menu\">Low-carb diets</a>&nbsp;can aid weight loss (<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-5491.2007.02290.x/full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>,&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12679447\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">9<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>\r\n<p>In many cases, this happens even without conscious calorie restriction.

While the obesity epidemic started around 1980, humans have been eating carbs for a very long time.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, whole foods that are&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-healthy-high-carb-foods\">high in carbs</a>&nbsp;are very healthy.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand,&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-refined-carbs-are-bad\">refined carbs</a>&nbsp;like refined grains and sugar are definitely linked to weight gain.</p>\r\n<h2>7. Fat makes you fat</h2>\r\n<p>Fat provides around 9 calories per gram, compared with only 4 calories per gram of carbs or protein.</p>\r\n<p>Fat is very calorie-dense and commonplace in junk foods. Yet, as long as your calorie intake is within a healthy range, fat does not make you fat.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, diets that are high in fat but low in carbs have been shown to cause weight loss in&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/23-studies-on-low-carb-and-low-fat-diets\">numerous studies</a>&nbsp;(<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2008.00518.x/abstract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">12<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>\r\n<p>While packing your diet with unhealthy, high-calorie junk foods laden with fat will definitely make you fat, this macronutrient is not the sole culprit.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, your body needs&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-super-healthy-high-fat-foods\">healthy fats</a>&nbsp;to function properly.</p>\r\n<h2>8.

Fast food is always fattening</h2>\r\n<p>Not all fast food is unhealthy.</p>\r\n<p>Because of people&rsquo;s increased health consciousness,&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-healthy-fast-food-restaurants\">many fast food chains</a>&nbsp;have started offering healthier options.</p>\r\n<p>Some, such as Chipotle, even focus exclusively on serving&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/50-super-healthy-foods\">healthy foods</a>.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible to get something relatively healthy at most restaurants. Most cheap fast food restaurants often provide healthier alternatives to their main offerings.</p>\r\n<p>These foods may not satisfy the demands of every health-conscious individual, but they&rsquo;re still a decent choice if you don&rsquo;t have the time or energy to cook a healthy meal.</p>\r\n<h2>10. Weight loss diets work</h2>\r\n<p>The weight loss industry wants you to believe that diets work.</p>\r\n<p>However, studies show that dieting rarely works in the long-term. Notably, 85% of dieters end up gaining the weight back within a year (<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1467-789x.2000.00019.x/full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">16<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, studies indicate that people who diet are most likely to gain weight in the future.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, dieting is a consistent predictor of future weight gain &mdash; not loss (<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3759019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">17<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>\r\n<p>The truth is that you probably shouldn&rsquo;t approach weight loss with a dieting mindset. Instead, make it a goal to&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-baby-steps-optimal-nutrition\">change your lifestyle permanently</a>&nbsp;and become a healthier, happier, and fitter person.</p>\r\n<p>If you manage to increase your activity levels, eat healthier, and&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-reasons-why-good-sleep-is-important\">sleep better</a>, you should lose weight as a natural side effect. Dieting probably won&rsquo;t work in the long term.</p>\r\n<h2>11.

Diet foods can help you lose weight</h2>\r\n<p>A lot of junk food is marketed as healthy.</p>\r\n<p>Examples include low-fat, fat-free, and processed gluten-free foods, as well as&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/liquid-sugar-calories\">high-sugar beverages</a>.</p>\r\n<p>You should be skeptical of any health claims on food packaging, especially on processed items. These&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-read-food-labels\">labels</a>&nbsp;usually exist to deceive &mdash; not inform.</p>\r\n<p>Some junk food marketers will encourage you to buy their fattening junk food.

overwhelming. Between letter vitamins, herbal supplements, and multivitamins, you may have trouble choosing which products are best for you and understanding how to select the highest quality product.</p>\r\n<p class=\"responsive\">What&rsquo;s more, some people find it challenging to remember to take vitamins and to refill them when they run out.</p>\r\n<p class=\"responsive\">That&rsquo;s where vitamin subscription services come in. These services take the guesswork out of vitamin purchases by offering suggestions based on questionnaires or blood testing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"responsive\">These companies also automatically ship monthly refills so that you never run out. Some even package your daily vitamins in individual envelopes, making it easy to grab the day&rsquo;s vitamins without opening multiple bottles.</p>\r\n<p>Healthline&rsquo;s dietitians looked at 12 of the most popular personalized vitamin services on the market, and only 8 services ultimately passed both our dietitians&rsquo; review and our internal vetting process.</p>\r\n<h2>How we chose these vitamin subscription services</h2>\r\n<p>We determined the best personalized vitamins and vitamin subscription services using the following criteria:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"responsive\">\r\n<li><strong>Quality:</strong>&nbsp;Are the supplements made from high quality ingredients and free of artificial additives such as colors and preservatives? Are the products third-party tested, or do they undergo testing at multiple stages of manufacturing?</li>\r\n<li><strong>Selection:</strong>&nbsp;Does the service offer a wide selection of products to meet the needs of most people?</li>\r\n<li><strong>Individualization:</strong>&nbsp;Does the company provide recommendations based on a health assessment or test and allow you to add or remove products as you see fit?</li>\r\n<li><strong>Helpfulness:</strong>&nbsp;Does the service provide evidence-based information about the supplements it recommends or access to health professionals, such as doctors or registered dietitians (RDs), for paying members?</li>\r\n<li><strong>Compliance with FDA guidelines:</strong>&nbsp;The brands on our list adhere to allowable health claims and labeling requirements, per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. They also manufacture products in facilities that adhere to the current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs) established by the FDA.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Hands-on testing:&nbsp;</strong>Healthline editors and writers tested several services to see whether each one was seamless from signup to delivery. We also paid attention to how easy the supplements were to take and whether there were any side effects.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Vetting:</strong>&nbsp;The brands on our list have been vetted to ensure that they align with Healthline&rsquo;s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being.

If you&rsquo;re looking for affordability, Nurish by Nature Made is a good option.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\" responsive\">Is the brand known for making high quality products?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"responsive\">Finally, make sure that the vitamin subscription service you choose is reputable and transparent, meaning that the company&rsquo;s products are manufactured in facilities that adhere to the CGMPs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"responsive\">Because the FDA doesn&rsquo;t regulate dietary supplements the same way that it does pharmaceuticals, it&rsquo;s also a good idea to choose supplements that are third-party tested to verify that the contents of the bottle match what is listed on the label.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2>Are personalized vitamin services worth it?</h2>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"responsive\">Whether a personalized vitamin service is worth it depends on the service and whether you value the convenience it offers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"responsive\">In particular, these services can be beneficial for people who are unsure of which supplements they should be taking and people who regularly forget to reorder their supplements.</p>\r\n<p class=\"responsive\">Some services offer additional features, such as access to a dietitian, that may make them worth a slightly higher cost.</p>\r\n<p class=\"responsive\">Still, keep in mind that these services are typically more expensive than buying supplements from a local or online pharmacy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"responsive\">Additionally, the health quizzes that many personalized vitamin companies use are not a substitute for a thorough medical review by a healthcare professional. And the quizzes may recommend more supplements than you need.</p>\r\n<p class=\"responsive\">It&rsquo;s best to share your supplement recommendations with a trusted healthcare professional, such as a doctor or dietitian, before clicking the subscribe button.</p>\r\n<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>\r\n<h3 class=\" responsive\">Do you need to take vitamins?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"responsive\">Most people can meet their nutritional needs by following a&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-eat-healthy-guide\">healthy diet</a>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"responsive\">However, vitamins can be beneficial in some cases, especially for people with certain health conditions or restrictive diets.</p>\r\n<p class=\"responsive\">Your doctor or dietitian can help determine whether you may benefit from adding vitamins or other supplements to your routine.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\" responsive\">How much do Persona vitamins cost?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"responsive\">Your monthly subscription price for Persona Nutrition can vary and may depend on several factors, including the specific supplements you add to your daily vitamin pack. However, each individual supplement can range from around $2&ndash;$39 for a 28-day supply.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\" responsive\">Are personalized vitamins safe?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"responsive\">Personalized supplements provide the same vitamins and minerals as regular supplements and are generally safe for most healthy adults when used as directed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"responsive\">However, if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications, it&rsquo;s best to check in with a doctor before adding new supplements to your routine.</p>\r\n<p>And, whenever possible, it&rsquo;s best to opt for products that have been through third-party testing, which can help ensure safety and quality.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\" responsive\">Are personalized supplements worth it?</h3>\r\n<p>Personalized vitamin subscriptions may be worth the price if you enjoy having a customized supplement routine catered to your unique needs. Additionally, many services offer simple daily packs, which can be a convenient and space-saving alternative to dealing with multiple vitamin bottles each day.</p>\r\n<h3>Can I design my own vitamins?</h3>\r\n<p>Many vitamin brands provide customized supplement recommendations based on factors such as your age, gender, and health goals.</p>\r\n<p>Vous Vitamin also offers personalized vitamins, which are formulated with a unique blend of nutrients tailored to your needs.</p>\r\n</div>",

But, there are a few additional things you can try to help yourself feel better. If you&rsquo;re at risk of flu complications, you might also want to check in with your doctor.</p>\r\n<p>The flu is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by the influenza virus. Flu symptoms typically last about a week, but the most severe symptoms only occur for two to three days (though it might feel like an eternity). You might continue to experience fatigue, weakness, and a cough for another week after you recover.</p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve partnered with&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.clorox.com/learn/topics/cold-and-flu-prevention-for-parents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clorox&reg;</a>&nbsp;to bring you 12 tips to help you recover more quickly.</p>\r\n<h2>1. Stay home</h2>\r\n<p>Your body needs time and energy to fight off the flu virus, which means that your daily routine should be put on the backburner.</p>\r\n<p>You may be tempted to go grocery shopping or get ahead on laundry for the week, but you&rsquo;d be doing yourself a disservice. Stay home from work or school, and put errands on hold until you start to feel better.</p>\r\n<p>On top of helping you recover, staying home also prevents spreading the flu to other people in your community or workplace. The flu can be dangerous for older adults and small children, so it&rsquo;s vital that you avoid contact with others while you&rsquo;re contagious and disinfect surfaces and personal items regularly.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://shop.clorox.com/products/clorox-disinfecting-wipes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clorox&reg; Disinfecting Wipes</a>&nbsp;are bleach-free and EPA-registered to kill SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.* The wipes can be used to disinfect multiple surfaces, including sealed granite, finished wood, and stainless steel.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Hydrate</h2>\r\n<p>One symptom of the flu is a high fever, which can lead to sweating. You might also be dealing with bouts of vomiting or diarrhea. Your body needs plenty of fluids to replace lost liquids, and even more to fight off the infection.</p>\r\n<p>Water is best, but you can also drink herbal teas or tea with honey. These can have a soothing effect on your symptoms while keeping you hydrated. Two things you should always avoid, though, are alcohol and caffeine.</p>\r\n<h2>3. Sleep as much as possible</h2>\r\n<p>Sleep is the best medicine for your body while fighting the flu. Watching TV curled up on the couch isn&rsquo;t a bad idea, but you shouldn&rsquo;t be binge-watching your favorite Netflix show all night long.</p>\r\n<p>Go to bed earlier than usual and sleep in. You can also take a nap during the day to give your body more time to recover.</p>\r\n<p>Rest and sleep also reduces your risk of serious&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717 sl\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/flu-complications\">flu complications</a>, like pneumonia.</p>\r\n<h2>4. Ease your breathing</h2>\r\n<p>It can be difficult to sleep with a stuffy nose and cough. Try these tips to breathe easier and have a better night&rsquo;s sleep:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Use an extra pillow<br />to prop up your head and ease sinus pressure.</li>\r\n<li>Sleep with a<br />humidifier or vaporizer in the room.</li>\r\n<li>Take a hot<br />bath or shower before bed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>5. Eat healthy foods</h2>\r\n<p>You may be tempted to drown your sorrow in a bowl of ice cream and a bag of potato chips, but your body needs better nutrition to recover from the flu.</p>\r\n<p>Fresh fruits and vegetables provide important vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that strengthen your immune system as it fights off the virus.</p>\r\n<p>You might not have much of an appetite, but it&rsquo;s still important to eat regular meals to maintain your strength.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Add moisture to the air</h2>\r\n<p>Dry air can make your symptoms worse. A vaporizer or humidifier adds moisture to the air and can help loosen up congestion.</p>\r\n<p>There are many types of humidifiers and vaporizers available on the market. Examples include cool-mist humidifiers and steam vaporizers. These can be found easily for a reasonable price at your local big-box store, pharmacy, or online.</p>\r\n<h2>7. Take OTC medications</h2>\r\n<p>The cold and flu aisle of your local drug store is most likely packed with hundreds of different options. Some medications are used to deal with specific symptoms, like nasal congestion, while others treat many flu symptoms at once.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Pain relievers</strong>&nbsp;help reduce a fever, headache, and body aches. Examples include ibuprofen (Advil,<br />Motrin) and acetaminophen (Tylenol).</li>\r\n<li><strong>Decongestants</strong>, like pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), help open your nasal passages and relieve<br />pressure in your sinuses.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Cough suppressants</strong>, such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin), can be used to soothe a dry cough.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Expectorants</strong>&nbsp;helps loosen thick mucus and are useful for a cough that is wet and produces mucus.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Antihistamines&nbsp;</strong>tend to have sedative effects that may help you sleep.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Be sure to read the product&rsquo;s label to learn the correct dose for each type of medication and to make sure you&rsquo;re not accidentally combining medications. Medications like DayQuil are both a pain reliever and a fever reducer, so you shouldn&rsquo;t be taking another medication on top of that.</p>\r\n<p>Children and teens should never take aspirin for the flu due to the risk of a serious condition called Reye&rsquo;s syndrome.</p>\r\n<h2>8. Try elderberry</h2>\r\n<p>Elderberry has been used for hundreds of years in the treatment of colds and the flu.</p>\r\n<p>In one&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"http://omicron-pharma.com/pdfs/ElderberryClinicalOJPK_Published.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">placebo-controlled study</a>, people with the flu who consumed elderberry lozenges four times a day experienced a reduction in fever, headache, muscle aches, nasal congestion, and cough after 48 hours.</p>\r\n<p>In another&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15080016\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>, 60 people with flu-like symptoms who ingested 15 milliliters of elderberry syrup four times a day experienced improvement in their symptoms four days earlier than people who took a placebo.</p>\r\n<p>A larger&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848651/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;in 312 air travelers found that 300 milligram capsules of elderberry extract taken three times per day reduced cold and flu symptoms and duration in those who ended up getting sick after their travels compared to a placebo group.</p>\r\n<p>Elderberry capsules, lozenges, and syrups are available in stores or online. You shouldn&rsquo;t eat raw elderberries, as they can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.</p>\r\n<p>Remember, elderberry is a complementary therapy, so make sure you&rsquo;re also treating the flu with OTC or prescription medication.</p>\r\n<h2>9. Have a spoonful of honey to soothe a cough</h2>\r\n<p>Honey is a fairly common natural remedy for soothing a sore throat or cough. Mixing honey with tea is a great way to stay hydrated while also treating your flu symptoms.</p>\r\n<p>In one&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18056558\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>, researchers found that a dose of honey was more effective at controlling a nighttime cough than common cough suppressants in children ages two to 18 years with upper respiratory tract infections.</p>\r\n<p>One thing to note, though, is that you shouldn&rsquo;t give honey to children who are younger than a year old.</p>\r\n<h2>10. Ask your doctor about antiviral drugs</h2>\r\n<p>Antiviral drugs are only available by prescription, so you must see a doctor first. These medications are typically reserved for people who are&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy866\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">at high risk of developing complications from the flu</a>.</p>\r\n<p>These drugs prevent the virus from growing and replicating. They work best if you take them within 48 hours of having symptoms.</p>\r\n<p>You may want to ask a doctor for a prescription antiviral if you:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>are under age 5 (age 2, in particular)</li>\r\n<li>are 18 or under and taking aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications</li>\r\n<li>are at least 65</li>\r\n<li>are pregnant or have given birth in the last two weeks</li>\r\n<li>have a chronic medical condition or you&rsquo;re taking other medications that weaken your immune system</li>\r\n<li>live in a nursing home or long-term care facility</li>\r\n<li>are Native American (American Indian or Alaska Native)</li>\r\n<li>are extremely obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 40</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The antiviral medication most commonly prescribed is oseltamivir (Tamiflu). In October 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza), a new antiviral for people ages 12 and older.</p>\r\n<p>Taking antiviral medications within two days of the onset of symptoms may reduce both the duration of the flu by about one day and the severity of symptoms.</p>\r\n<h2>11. Get a flu shot</h2>\r\n<p>The annual flu vaccine is produced based on scientists&rsquo; predictions of which flu strain will dominate the next flu season. Sometimes, though, they get it wrong. Getting a flu shot after you&rsquo;ve already had the flu can protect you from other strains of the virus.</p>\r\n<p>You might think it&rsquo;s too late or that you can&rsquo;t get the flu again in one season, but it&rsquo;s still a possibility. So, it&rsquo;s a good idea to protect yourself by getting vaccinated.</p>\r\n<h2>12. Stay positive</h2>\r\n<p>We often forget how much our emotions and attitudes affect how we feel physically. While you may not be able to unclog your stuffy nose or lower your fever with positive thoughts, maintaining a positive attitude during your illness may help in your overall recovery.</p>",

According to the&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com//www.cdc.gov/sleep\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>, more than one-quarter of the U.S. population reports not getting enough sleep from time to time. Insufficient sleep raises your risk of accidental injury and many chronic health conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, and depression.</p>\r\n<p>Getting the rest you need may require some lifestyle changes. It&rsquo;s important to develop habits that promote good health and eliminate those that keep you up at night. Here are some tips to help you improve your sleep hygiene and prepare the perfect environment to catch some Zzz&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n<h2>Establish a routine</h2>\r\n<p>A consistent sleep schedule is a critical part of developing good sleep hygiene. According to the&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com//www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/adult-health/in-depth/sleep/art-20048379\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mayo Clinic</a>, frequently changing the times you go to bed and wake up confuses your body&rsquo;s biological clock. Following a regular schedule, even on weekends and holidays, can help you get the rest you need.</p>\r\n<p>To stick to a schedule, prepare your mind and body for sleep by developing a relaxing&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717 sl\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health-news/its-not-just-for-kids-even-adults-appear-to-benefit-from-a-regular-bedtime\">bedtime routine</a>&nbsp;that begins around the same time each evening. For example, take a warm bath, listen to soothing music, read a book, or do other activities that help you wind down. This will signal to your body that bedtime is coming and help you fall asleep more quickly and easily.</p>\r\n<h2>Keep electronics out of your bed</h2>\r\n<p>Try to separate your bedroom from other facets of your life that may cause stress, tension, or stimulation. According to the&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://sleepfoundation.org/excessivesleepiness/sleep-tools-tips/healthy-sleep-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Sleep Foundation</a>, the presence of electronic devices such as laptops and cell phones can make it harder to fall asleep.</p>\r\n<p>The blue light from glowing electronic screens suppresses your body&rsquo;s production of melatonin, an important hormone for sleep. If you tend to associate your bed with activities other than sleep or sex, that can also make it harder to calm your mind and drift off.</p>\r\n<p>Avoid watching television, using your computer, or checking your phone in bed. You should also avoid working, eating, or even having a heated discussion with your significant other in your sleeping environment. Strengthening the association between your bed and sleep may help you clear your mind at bedtime.</p>\r\n<h2>Set the scene</h2>\r\n<p>Imagine yourself in a perfect slumber. What does the room look like? How does that compare to your current bedroom? According to the&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com//www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/adult-health/in-depth/sleep/art-20048379?pg=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mayo Clinic</a>, improving your sleep may mean making changes to your environment.</p>\r\n<p>First, examine your bed. Is it large enough? Do you wake up with a sore neck? Do you constantly bump knees with your spouse? A new bed,&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717 sl\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sleep/wink-mattress-review\">mattress</a>,&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sleep/best-pillow\">pillow</a>, or&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717 sl\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sleep/best-cooling-comforter\">comforter</a>&nbsp;could make a huge difference.</p>\r\n<p>Next, think about your bedroom at night. Light, sound, and temperature are some of the most common causes of sleep disruption. Try finding ways to moderate those factors and create a consistently quiet, dark, and cool environment.</p>\r\n<p>If you can&rsquo;t ignore the noises around you, invest in&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717 sl\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/best-earplugs-for-sleeping\">earplugs</a>, a fan, or a&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717 sl\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sleep/best-white-noise-machines\">sound machine</a>&nbsp;that produces soothing&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717 sl\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/sleep/why-white-noise-may-help-you-get-your-best-sleep-ever\">white noise</a>. Use window shades or blinds to block light from outside and make sure any indoor lights are off. Lastly, keep the temperature of your room consistently comfortable and cool.</p>\r\n<h2>Mind what you drink</h2>\r\n<p>What you drink in the hours before bedtime can make or break your ability to fall asleep. Caffeine and alcohol are two common sleep disrupting culprits.</p>\r\n<p>Caffeine is a stimulant that can keep you awake. According to the&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com//healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/getting/overcoming/tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School</a>, the effects of caffeine can take six to eight hours to wear off. So avoid drinking caffeinated beverages, such as coffee or soda, in the late afternoon or evening.</p>\r\n<p>Alcohol is a sedative that can make you tired, but it also disrupts the quality of your sleep. It can result in lighter and less restorative&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717 sl\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sleep/how-to-get-more-rem-sleep\">stages of sleep</a>, which can leave you feeling groggy the next morning. Avoid drinking alcohol within three hours of bedtime, and limit yourself to one to two alcoholic beverages per day.</p>\r\n<p>Try drinking a small cup of something with a calming effect before bed, such as hot herbal tea or milk. Drinking too much of any liquid before bed may lead to bathroom trips during the night, which can also disrupt your sleep.</p>\r\n<h2>Get up and try again</h2>\r\n<p>Even with these tips, you might find it hard to fall asleep sometimes. While following a regular sleep schedule is important, forcing yourself to sleep rarely works.</p>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re still lying awake after 15 minutes of trying to fall asleep, get out of bed and do something else, suggests the&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com//www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/adult-health/in-depth/sleep/art-20048379?pg=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mayo Clinic</a>. For example, go through your bedtime relaxation ritual again. Take a bath, read, or listen to soothing music. Then go back to bed when the anxiety of not being able to fall asleep is gone.</p>\r\n<p>No matter how tempted you are, don&rsquo;t turn on the television, get on your computer, or check your texts or email. Try not to expose yourself to bright light, extreme temperatures, or loud sounds. These stimulating activities will only make it harder for you to get into sleep mode.</p>\r\n<h2>What you can do now</h2>\r\n<p>Practicing good sleep hygiene can help you fall asleep more quickly and enjoy better quality sleep. Follow a regular sleep schedule, develop a relaxing bedtime routine, and create an environment that helps you doze off. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and glowing electronic screens in the hours before bedtime. If you can&rsquo;t fall asleep, don&rsquo;t force it. Get up and enjoy some relaxing activities. Then try again when you feel more restful.</p>\r\n<p>If sleep still remains a struggle, speak to your doctor. An underlying health condition or other factors may be affecting your ability to sleep. Your doctor may recommend additional lifestyle changes, medications, or other strategies to help you get the rest you need.</p>",

That means the effect on prostate cancer goes up or down with the amount of coffee you drink. However, these effects may not extend to someone who only grabs an occasional cup.</p>\r\n<p>Keep in mind that high doses of&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-coffee-should-you-drink\">caffeine</a>&nbsp;can cause side effects, such as upset stomach, rapid heart rate, and trouble sleeping.

It found that prostate cancer was the only cancer type on which folic acid supplementation appeared to boost risk.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, a&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/pcan201416\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">systematic review and meta-analysis<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;from 2014 looked into this topic further. It found that both dietary and total folate intake, which also included folic acid, had no significant association with prostate cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Dairy</h3>\r\n<p><a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/8-fast-facts-about-calcium\">Calcium</a>&nbsp;has a variety of important benefits for your health. Some studies, according to the&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/risk-factors.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ACS<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>, have linked dairy products, or diets&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/15-calcium-rich-foods\">high in calcium</a>, with an increased risk of prostate cancer. However, studies have been mixed, and this risk hasn&rsquo;t been linked to normal dietary intake of calcium.</p>\r\n<h2>Make time for exercise</h2>\r\n<p>Having overweight or&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-being-overweight-increases-risk-of-cancer\">obesity</a>&nbsp;is linked to an increased risk of several types of cancer. However, generally speaking, the connection between prostate cancer risk and weight appears to be complex.</p>\r\n<p>One&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-020-07089-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2020 study<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;found that there was only a very weak association between&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/body-mass-index\">body mass index (BMI)</a>&nbsp;and prostate cancer risk. However, when researchers adjusted for&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/waistline\">waist circumference</a>, they saw that increasing BMI was associated with higher prostate cancer risk in those with a larger waist circumference.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also important to note that having overweight or&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/obesity\">obesity</a>&nbsp;can have a negative effect if you&rsquo;ve already been diagnosed with prostate cancer. For example, there&rsquo;s an&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1040842821003309\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">increased risk</a>&nbsp;of prostate cancer progression and recurrence in these individuals.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise\">Regular exercise</a>&nbsp;can help you manage your weight. Benefits of exercise include increased muscle mass, better metabolism, and improved cardiovascular health. Try activities like:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>walking</li>\r\n<li>running</li>\r\n<li>bicycling</li>\r\n<li>swimming</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Exercise doesn&rsquo;t have to be boring. Change up your routine and invite your friends to participate. You&rsquo;re more likely to work out if it&rsquo;s fun.</p>\r\n<h2>Talk with a doctor</h2>\r\n<p>Ask your doctor about your risk of developing prostate cancer. Some points to discuss include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>what medical screening tests you should have as you age</li>\r\n<li>your personal or family history of cancer</li>\r\n<li>dietary or other health-related recommendations</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Tell your doctor if you&rsquo;re experiencing symptoms that may be warning signs of&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/prostate-cancer\">prostate cancer</a>, such as:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>urinary problems, like:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/urination-difficulty-with-flow\">weak urine stream or difficulties with starting to urinate</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/frequent-or-urgent-urination\">frequent or sudden need to urinate</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/urination-painful\">painful or a burning sensation while urinating</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/urinary-retention\">feeling like your bladder isn&rsquo;t empty after urination</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>noticing blood in your&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/urine-bloody\">urine</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/blood-in-the-semen\">semen</a></li>\r\n<li>having discomfort or pain anywhere in your&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/pelvic-pain-in-men\">pelvis</a>,&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/hip-pain\">hips</a>, or&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/low-back-pain-acute\">back</a>&nbsp;that doesn&rsquo;t go away</li>\r\n<li>experiencing&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/erectile-dysfunction\">trouble getting or maintaining an erection</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Frequently asked questions about prostate cancer</h2>\r\n<p>Below, we&rsquo;ll try to answer some of the additional questions that you may have about prostate cancer.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>How common is prostate cancer?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>According to the&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ACS<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>, aside from&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/types-of-skin-cancer\">skin cancer</a>, prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer in men in the United States. It&rsquo;s estimated that about 1 in 8 men will develop prostate cancer at some point in their life.</p>\r\n<p>The ACS estimates that about&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">268,490 men<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;in the United States will be newly diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2022. Additionally, about 34,500 men in the United States will die from prostate cancer in 2022.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>What are the other risk factors for prostate cancer?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>In addition to some of the factors we&rsquo;ve discussed above, there are several other known&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/prostate-cancer-risk-factors\">risk factors</a>&nbsp;for prostate cancer. These include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Age.</strong>&nbsp;Your risk of prostate cancer increases as you get older. According to the ACS, around&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/risk-factors.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">6 in 10 diagnoses<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;of prostate cancer happen in men who are older than 65.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Family history.</strong>&nbsp;If a close biological relative, such as a father or brother, has had prostate cancer, you may be at an increased risk of developing it.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Race.</strong>&nbsp;Although the reasons why are unclear, prostate cancer appears to be&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/risk-factors.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more common<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;in African American men. More research is needed to determine why.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Geographic location.</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s unknown exactly why, but prostate cancer is more common in regions of the world like North America, the Caribbean, Europe, and Australia.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Genetic changes.</strong>&nbsp;Some inherited genetic changes, such as those in genes like&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/brca-gene-testing\"><em>BRCA1</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>BRCA2</em></a>, may boost your risk of prostate cancer. Additionally, men with an inherited condition called Lynch syndrome are also at a higher risk.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>What&rsquo;s the outlook for prostate cancer?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>When prostate cancer is found early, the outlook is quite good. According to the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, the overall 5-year survival rate of prostate cancer between 2011 and 2017 was&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/prost.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">97.5 percent<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>.</p>\r\n<p>SEER breaks down these statistics further based on the extent of the cancer at diagnosis:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Localized.</strong>&nbsp;When cancer remains in the prostate, 5-year survival is nearly 100 percent.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Regional.</strong>&nbsp;If cancer is in the prostate and nearby lymph nodes, the 5-year survival rate is still nearly 100 percent.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Distant.</strong>&nbsp;When the cancer has spread to other organs and tissues, the 5-year survival rate drops to 30.6 percent.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Most prostate cancers are diagnosed when they&rsquo;re either localized or regional.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>What types of treatments are used for prostate cancer?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re diagnosed with prostate cancer, your doctor will help to develop a&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/prostate-cancer-treatments\">treatment plan</a>&nbsp;that&rsquo;s right for your individual situation. It&rsquo;s possible that a combination of different treatment options may be used.</p>\r\n<p>They may recommend something called expectant management if your cancer doesn&rsquo;t cause symptoms. During this time, they may monitor your cancer using a variety of tests. Treatment will begin when you develop symptoms or when test results find the cancer is growing.</p>\r\n<p>Other potential treatment options can include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Surgery.</strong>&nbsp;If you only have cancer in your prostate, your doctor may suggest&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/prostate-surgery\">surgery</a>&nbsp;to remove the tumor or your prostate.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Radiation therapy.</strong>&nbsp;In&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/radiation-therapy\">radiation therapy</a>, high energy radiation is used to kill cancer cells.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Cryotherapy.</strong>&nbsp;During&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/cryosurgery\">cryotherapy</a>, a special probe is used to freeze and kill cells in your prostate, including cancer cells.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Hormone therapy.</strong>&nbsp;This treatment focuses on blocking hormones that can encourage cancer growth.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Chemotherapy.</strong>&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/prostate-cancer/chemotherapy-for-prostate-cancer\">Chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;drugs can kill cancer cells or slow down their growth.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Immunotherapy.</strong>&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-black-men-benefit-from-immunotherapy-for-prostate-cancer\">Immunotherapy</a>&nbsp;harnesses your immune system to help treat prostate cancer. A type of immunotherapy called&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/prostate-cancer/provenge\">sipuleucel-T (Provenge)</a>&nbsp;may be used to treat some types of prostate cancer.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Targeted therapy.</strong>&nbsp;Targeted therapy blocks the activity of certain proteins on or in cancer cells. Drugs called&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health-news/gene-targeting-medication-for-prostate-cancer-does-well-in-clinical-trial\">PARP inhibitors</a>&nbsp;may be used to treat some types of prostate cancer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>How do I keep my prostate healthy?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Doing the following things in your daily life can help you keep your prostate healthy:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Exercise.</strong>&nbsp;Getting regular exercise is great for your health and for preventing a variety of medical conditions. Because of this, aim to exercise most days of the week. If you&rsquo;re unsure where to start, ask your doctor about types of exercise that are appropriate for you.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Eat a balanced diet.</strong>&nbsp;Try to eat a&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/balanced-diet\">balanced diet</a>&nbsp;that&rsquo;s rich in foods like whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and lean protein sources. Reduce your intake of&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/is-red-meat-bad-for-you-or-good\">red meats</a>&nbsp;and foods that are high in&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/18-surprising-foods-high-in-sugar\">sugar</a>,&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-refined-carbs-are-bad\">refined carbohydrates</a>, or&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease/good-fats-vs-bad-fats\">unhealthy fats</a>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Manage weight.</strong>&nbsp;If you have overweight or obesity, it&rsquo;s important to take steps to manage your weight.

However, there are some steps you can take to lower your risk.</p>\r\n<p>For example, it&rsquo;s possible that some types of food and drinks may lower prostate cancer risk. Examples include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>red fruits or vegetables like tomatoes</li>\r\n<li>soybeans</li>\r\n<li>green tea</li>\r\n<li>coffee</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Reducing your intake of fats, particularly red meat, may also help reduce your risk.</p>\r\n<p>Aside from diet, other lifestyle factors are also important. Try to take steps to quit smoking, manage your weight, and get regular exercise.</p>\r\n<p>Never hesitate to see your doctor if you develop potential prostate cancer warning signs like urinary problems or pain in your pelvis, hips, or back. If these symptoms aren&rsquo;t caused by prostate cancer, they may be due to another condition that needs to be treated.</p>",

A body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher is an indicator of obesity.</p>\r\n<p>Over the last few decades, obesity has become a considerable health problem. In fact, it&rsquo;s now considered to be an epidemic in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), roughly&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">93.3 million adults<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;(39.8 percent) and&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/childhood.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">13.7 million children and teens<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;(18.5 percent) in the United States are obese.</p>\r\n<p>Despite the rising percentages, there are plenty of ways to prevent obesity in both kids and adults. Here we&rsquo;ll explore both, as well as how far we&rsquo;ve come in preventing obesity.</p>\r\n<h2>Obesity prevention for kids</h2>\r\n<p>Obesity prevention begins at a young age. It&rsquo;s important to help young people maintain a healthy weight without focusing on the scale.</p>\r\n<h3>Breastfeed infants, when possible</h3>\r\n<p>One&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4301835/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2014 analysis<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;of 25 studies found that breastfeeding was associated with a reduced risk of childhood obesity. However, studies are mixed when it comes to the role of breastfeeding in obesity prevention, and more research is needed.</p>\r\n<h3>Feed growing children appropriate portion sizes</h3>\r\n<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics explains that&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/nutrition/Pages/Serving-Sizes-for-Toddlers.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">toddlers</a>&nbsp;don&rsquo;t require huge amounts of food. From ages 1 to 3, every inch of height should equate to roughly 40 calories of food intake.</p>\r\n<p>Encourage older children to learn what&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.eatright.org/food/nutrition/dietary-guidelines-and-myplate/kids-and-portion-control\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">various portion sizes</a>&nbsp;look like.</p>\r\n<h3>Build early relationships with healthy foods</h3>\r\n<p>Encourage your child to try a variety of different fruits, vegetables, and proteins from an early age. As they grow older, they may be more likely to incorporate these healthy foods into their own diet.</p>\r\n<h3>Eat healthy foods as a family</h3>\r\n<p>Changing eating habits as a family allows children to experience healthy eating early on. This will make it easier for them to continue following good eating habits as they grow into adults.</p>\r\n<h3>Encourage eating slowly and only when hungry</h3>\r\n<p>Overeating can happen if you eat when you&rsquo;re not hungry. This excess fuel eventually becomes stored as body fat and can lead to obesity. Encourage your child to eat only when they feel hungry and to chew more slowly for better digestion.</p>\r\n<h3>Limit unhealthy foods in the household</h3>\r\n<p>If you bring unhealthy foods into the household, your child may be more likely to eat them. Try to stock the fridge and pantry with healthy foods, and allow less-healthy snacks as a rare &ldquo;treat&rdquo; instead.</p>\r\n<h3>Incorporate fun and exciting physical activity</h3>\r\n<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that kids and teens get at least&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_young_people/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">60 minutes<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;of physical activity daily. Fun physical activities include games, sports, gym class, or even outdoor chores.</p>\r\n<h3>Limit your child&rsquo;s screen time</h3>\r\n<p>More time spent sitting in front of a screen means less time for physical activity and good sleep. Because exercise and sleep play a role in a healthy weight, it&rsquo;s important to encourage those activities over computer or TV time.</p>\r\n<h3>Make sure everyone is getting enough sleep</h3>\r\n<p><a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/sleep/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Research</a>&nbsp;suggests that both&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4035591/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">children<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2723045/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">adults<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;who don&rsquo;t get enough sleep may end up weighing more. Healthy sleep habits from the&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-tools-tips/healthy-sleep-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Sleep Foundation</a>&nbsp;include a sleep schedule, a bedtime ritual, and a comfortable pillow and mattress.</p>\r\n<h3>Know what your child is eating outside of the home</h3>\r\n<p>Whether in school, with friends, or while being babysat, children have plenty of opportunities to eat unhealthy foods outside of the home. You can&rsquo;t always be there to monitor what they eat, but asking questions can help.</p>\r\n<h2>Obesity prevention for adults</h2>\r\n<p>Many of these obesity prevention tips are the same for losing or maintaining a healthy weight. The bottom is line that eating a healthy diet and getting more physical activity can help prevent obesity.</p>\r\n<h3>Consume less &ldquo;bad&rdquo; fat and more &ldquo;good&rdquo; fat</h3>\r\n<p>Contrary to the belief behind the low-fat diet craze of the &rsquo;90s, not all fat is bad.&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5577766/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5577766/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2017 study<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;published in the Nutrition Journal showed that intake of healthy dietary fats, such as polyunsaturated fats, can improve cholesterol levels and reduce obesity risk.</p>\r\n<h3>Consume less processed and sugary foods</h3>\r\n<p>According to a&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/104/5/1433/4564389\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2016 study<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,consumption of processed and ultra-processed foods is linked to a higher risk of obesity. Many processed foods are high in fat, salt, and sugar, which can encourage overeating.</p>\r\n<h3>Eat more servings of vegetables and fruits</h3>\r\n<p>The daily recommendation for fruit and vegetable intake is five to nine servings per day for adults. Filling your plate with veggies and fruit can help keep calories reasonable and reduce the risk of overeating.</p>\r\n<h3>Eat plenty of dietary fiber</h3>\r\n<p>Studies continue to show that dietary fiber plays a role in weight maintenance.

Focusing on low-GI foods can help keep blood sugar levels steadier. Keeping your blood glucose levels steady can help with weight management.</p>\r\n<h3>Get the family involved in your journey</h3>\r\n<p>Social support isn&rsquo;t just for children and teens &mdash; it&rsquo;s important for adults to feel supported too. Whether cooking with family or going on walks with friends, getting people involved can help to encourage a healthy lifestyle.</p>\r\n<h3>Engage in regular aerobic activity</h3>\r\n<p>Incorporating regular physical activity into your schedule is important for maintaining or losing weight, among other benefits. The&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/physical_activity/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CDC<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;recommends 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week.</p>\r\n<h3>Incorporate a weight training regimen</h3>\r\n<p>Weight training is just as important to weight maintenance as aerobic activity. In addition to weekly aerobic activity, the WHO recommends weight training that involves all your major muscles at least two times per week.</p>\r\n<h3>Focus on reducing daily stress</h3>\r\n<p>Stress can have&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/stress/effects-on-body\">many effects</a>&nbsp;on the body and mind. A&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3428710/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2012 study<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;suggests that stress may trigger a brain response that changes eating patterns and leads to cravings for high-calorie foods. Eating too many high-calorie foods can contribute to the development of obesity.</p>\r\n<h3>Learn how to food budget and meal prep</h3>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to grocery shop for healthy foods when you have a plan. Creating a food budget and list for your shopping trips can help avoid temptations for unhealthy foods. In addition, prepping meals can allow you to have ready-to-go healthy meals.</p>\r\n<h2>Why does prevention matter?</h2>\r\n<p>Preventing obesity plays an important role in good health. Obesity is associated with a long list of chronic health conditions, many of which become more difficult to treat over time.

The nurses visited babies a total of eight times after birth and encouraged the mothers to incorporate healthy practices. The researchers found that the average BMI of the children in this group was significantly lower than those of the control group (babies who didn&rsquo;t get the eight nurse visits).</p>\r\n<p>However, a&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5968487/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2018 trial<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;in Sweden looked at the effectiveness of a smartphone app to educate young children on healthy eating and physical activity.

The researchers found that both dietary changes and reduced TV time resulted in significant weight loss. They also found that family support helped encourage weight loss in children.</p>\r\n<p>Preventing obesity in adults involves regular physical activity, a decrease in saturated fat intake, a decrease in sugar consumption, and an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption. In addition, family and healthcare professional involvement may help to maintain a healthy weight.</p>\r\n<p>One&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2872299/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2010 review<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;of public health approaches found that there are various ways to influence public policy to encourage methods of obesity prevention: Altering food environments, creating policy-based changes in schools, and supporting medication and other medical strategies are all potential ways to prevent obesity.</p>\r\n<p>However, only some of these methods have proven to be effective, and there are barriers to using these methods.</p>\r\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\r\n<p>A healthy weight is important in maintaining good health. Taking steps to prevent obesity in your daily life is a good first step. Even small changes, such as eating more vegetables and visiting the gym a few times a week, can help to prevent obesity.</p>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in a more tailored approach to your diet, a dietitian or nutritionist can provide you with the tools to get started.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, meeting with a personal trainer or fitness instructor can help you find the physical activities that work best for your body.</p>",

Honey</h2>\r\n<p><a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/top-raw-honey-benefits\">Honey</a>&nbsp;is a time-honored remedy for a sore throat.</p>\r\n<p>According to a&nbsp;<a class=\"content-link css-5r4717\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6513626/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2018 review<span class=\"css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after\"><span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;on the effects of honey on acute cough in children, researchers found that honey may relieve coughs more effectively than some OTC medications.

It can be hard to know whether a poorly child has a cold or something else such as tonsillitis - an inflammation of the tonsils. So what are the signs of tonsillitis, and how can you treat it in your child?</p>\r\n<h2>What is tonsillitis?</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://patient.info/ears-nose-throat-mouth/sore-throat-2/tonsillitis\">Tonsillitis</a>&nbsp;is an inflammation of the tonsils and it's common in children, although adults and teenagers can get it too. It is normally caused by a virus, which spreads when we&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/chest-lungs/cough-leaflet\">cough</a>, sneeze, speak or are in physical contact with others. Sometimes, tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>What are the symptoms of tonsillitis in children?</h2>\r\n<p>Tonsillitis can feel like a bad&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/news-and-features/difference-between-cold-and-flu\">cold</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/infections/influenza-and-flu-like-illness\">flu</a>, but the tonsils at the back of the throat - the two round lumps - will be red and swollen.

But can stress also be a cause, triggering the problem in the first place?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the last decade, Alice Lang, 24, has struggled with severe&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/skin-conditions/acne-leaflet\">acne</a>. The condition, which as a teenager didn't really set her apart, took centre stage in her life when it persisted into adulthood, causing her a great deal of distress. The frequent breakouts of spots and the stigma attached to acne had a negative impact on her self-worth, often making her feel anxious and powerless as the years went by.</p>\r\n<p>\"Acne has been one of the biggest causes of stress in my life. That may sound shallow to some, but because of the constant influx of pretty, perfect faces on social media and in advertising, I just felt like I wasn't good enough. It made my self-esteem drop to rock bottom, so I wasn't confident in anything I was doing,\" explains Lang, who now seeks to empower others with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://notesbyalice.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a blog on her acne journey.</a></p>\r\n<p>She is not alone. Many people who have severe acne like her, but also people with other skin diseases such as psoriasis, report that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352647517300990\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">low self-esteem and anxiety are part of their daily lives.</a></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">A complex link</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A strong link exists between mental well-being and skin health, going way back to childhood, from the first skin-to-skin contact between mothers and their babies. Healthcare professionals have now established that acne and other skin problems can cause stress and poor mental health. However, this is a complex relationship, and untangling cause and effect is no easy feat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"The link between stress and dermatological conditions is difficult to study in humans. It has been suggested that some skin problems are exacerbated by stress. However, the other way around has also been well established. If patients have serious skin conditions, they will become more stressed,\" Dr Anton Alexandroff, consultant dermatologist and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.britishskinfoundation.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">British Skin Foundation</a>&nbsp;spokesperson, explains.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In a recent Patient survey, 90% of healthcare professionals agreed that stress could&nbsp;exacerbate&nbsp; skin problems. 92% said that skin problems could also make mental health problems such as stress, anxiety and depression worse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This is something that Lang is familiar with. Her acne is severe and persistent, and it wasn't initially caused by stress. Yet, over the years, she has noticed a correlation between her emotional state and the severity of her skin problems.</p>\r\n<p>\"I think the stress of feeling so bad about myself and so worried all the time, increased the severity of my acne. My skin would occasionally clear up, but then I'd get a small spot and worry myself all day that my spots were coming back - and I'd have five new ones the following morning,&rdquo; she says.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What does the research show?</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Research up to now has mostly focused on stress as a result of dermatological problems, rather than as a cause. In particular, scientists have investigated some of the most common dermatological conditions such as acne, eczema, alopecia, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/skin-conditions/psoriasis-leaflet\">psoriasis</a>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"It's important to note, however, that this group of patients has been more ready than other groups to come forward in terms of communicating. There are 'gaps' in research of other skin conditions which may reveal similar emotional and stressful experiences,\" says Simon Oates, CEO of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindandskin.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Mind &amp; Skin</a>, a charity working to improve patients' quality of life.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But studies investigating the role of stress in triggering skin problems have also emerged over the years. As early as the late 1970s, it was shown that patients with acne reported a worsening of the condition after going through a stressful event. Over the following decades, small questionnaire-based studies have confirmed this, showing that acne can be aggravated during stressful times,<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12873885\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">&nbsp;such as exam periods.</a>&nbsp;The same has been suggested with other conditions such as eczema or, to a lesser degree,<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjd.16116\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">&nbsp;psoriasis.</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The problem is that many of these studies still suffer from limitations, including small sample sizes, and the difficulty of conducting experiments in the lab to evaluate the impact of stress in real life.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The biological mechanisms linking stress and skin conditions also have yet to be clearly explained. But scientists have already established that chronic stress can interfere<a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Recognizing_the_mind-skin_connection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">&nbsp;with the immune system and with the permeability of the skin</a>, making it less efficient at keeping harmful substances out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, there is evidence that stress is associated with the production of certain hormones, or with the secretion of substances that promote inflammation in the body.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline are produced by people when they experience high levels of anxiety. Those can affect the skin and lead to problems,\" says Alexandroff.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How to deal with the stress of skin problems</h2>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Don't be afraid to seek medical help</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Skin problems often go hand in a hand with shame and stigma, especially because these are conditions that are immediately visible. An open relationship with your doctor is the first step to battle the condition and the stress that goes with it. This includes going to see a doctor for the actual condition, but also a mental health professional if the burden of skin problems becomes too much.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"I would advise all patients to be more open in communicating with their doctor. It is also important to understand that there is not always a 'cure' and that recovery of dermatological symptoms can take time to improve. I would also suggest patients enquire about mental health services. Unfortunately, they may have to be patient due to a lack of services and to high demand,\" Oates points out.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Open up to those close to you</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Being transparent to friends and family about how your skin problems are making you feel can be helpful to get some perspective.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Just talking through feelings and discussing acne really helped me - sometimes, you just need someone else to help you see things a little more rationally and remind you that you're much more than your skin,\" says Lang.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Turn to peer support and charities</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are many resources and support groups available online to discuss skin problems and stress. Online communities such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/forums\">Patient.info forums</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.psoriasis.org/talk-psoriasis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Talk Psoriasis Support Community</a>&nbsp;are good examples of platforms which can inspire patients to share their stories, and to boost each other's well-being by connecting, exchanging information, and meeting new friends.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Turning to charities such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.changingfaces.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Changing Faces</a>, which are doing a lot to raise awareness and to fight stigma, and joining their campaigns, can also be a good option. Interesting resources can also be found on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bad.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">British Association of Dermatologists&rsquo; website&nbsp;</a>and on Mind &amp; Skin, with a lot of up-to-date information, from podcasts to articles, to guide patients, including with stress management.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But it's acne awareness which has really increased a lot in recent years, with social media acting as a powerful platform to spread the message. On Instagram and YouTube, there are interesting channels dedicated to talking about acne and the stress it creates. More and more people are posting raw photos of pimples, redness and scars, to show the reality of living with acne, as well as video diaries, testimonials and treatment advice.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Be yourself</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most significant improvements will come from patients realising their worth as individuals, with or without skin problems.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"One of my best tips is to stop obsessing over your face. Looking in the mirror every hour will only tempt you to pick at your skin and obsess over the slightest change, leading to stress. Try not to worry about what people think. What I've come to realise as I've got a little older is that good people who genuinely care about you won't care about your skin problems,\" Lang says.</p>",

However, in reality, they can occur at any age. In fact, about 8 in every 100 heart attacks occur in those under 55, and 1 in 4 heart attacks in women affects an under-60. They are also twice as likely to be fatal in young women compared to young men, often because they are missed until too late.</p>\r\n<h2>A shock to the system</h2>\r\n<p>Hannah Wrigley was just 26 years old when she had a heart attack.</p>\r\n<p>\"My heart attack was completely unexpected. I was cleaning one Tuesday morning, and I started coughing rather dramatically. I suddenly collapsed to the ground with the worst imaginable burning in the centre of my chest and a crushing pain.\" A few hours later Hannah experienced a heavy left arm and a persistent feeling of pressure in her chest as well as feeling intensely nauseated.</p>\r\n<p>When an ambulance arrived, the ECG read 'acute MI (heart attack) in progress'. Despite this, it was not until Hannah underwent an angiogram a number of hours later that doctors agreed about her diagnosis, simply due to her age and lack of risk factors. Delays in treatment, especially in young women whose MIs are not recognised, can significantly affect outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>Hannah has since been found to have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/allergies-blood-immune/blood-clotting-tests/antiphospholipid-syndrome\">antiphospholipid syndrome</a>, a tendency for her blood to clot more than usual. Before the heart attack Hannah was a strict vegan and not overweight but says she was an anxious, highly strung person. The heart attack has made her revaluate and reassess her priorities.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h3>Taking appropriate action</h3>\r\n<p>The heart attack resulted in her making physical changes, including starting to eat oily fish and doing gentle yoga and Pilates. In addition, she reassessed her health behaviours and reduced a stressful lifestyle. \"I had a huge mental shift and reassessed my priorities, reducing levels of stress.\"</p>\r\n<p>She is also on medication to reduce the risk of her blood clotting again in the future and knows the signs and symptoms to look for. These signs include central crushing chest pain, or a heaviness or discomfort that may spread into the left arm, breathlessness, and nausea or grey tinge to your complexion. Importantly, women are less likely to get the 'classic' central crushing chest pain we see people collapsing with in TV soaps. Instead,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/blogs/sarah-says/2016/05/heart-attacks-in-women-the-classic-female-symptom-isn-t-severe-chest-pain\">symptoms in women are often more vague</a>&nbsp;- another possible reason for higher death rates among women. Knowing the signs can save lives.</p>\r\n<h2>Cardiac health in those who are active</h2>\r\n<p>Keeping active is thought to help keep your heart healthy. It is thought that being physically active can decrease your chance of heart disease or stroke by up to 50%, a fantastic incentive for people to get active. Regular exercise can help lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, help control weight and improve your general health and well-being as well.</p>\r\n<p>People who are very physically active (more than five hours of intense exercise a week) may develop an athlete&rsquo;s heart (athletic heart syndrome). This is a normal physiological change in their heart that takes place over time in response to exercise.</p>\r\n<p>The heart becomes enlarged and beats more slowly, pumping more blood each time it beats. No treatment is required for people with athletic heart syndrome and it does not pose any physical threats to the athlete. However, if these signs (slow heartbeat and an enlarged heart) occur in a non-athletic person, they need to be thoroughly investigated.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Sudden cardiac death in athletes</h2>\r\n<p>Sudden cardiac death is a natural unexpected death from a cardiac arrest (the heart stopping), and usually it occurs during exercise. As scary as it is seeing somebody like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/mar/25/muamba-collapse-minute-by-minute\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Fabrice Muamba</a>&nbsp;collapse in the middle of a Premier League football match, it is very rare.</p>\r\n<p>Usually it is caused by either an inherited heart condition or cardiovascular disease (a heart attack) even if the person is physically fit.</p>\r\n<p>It is important to remember that sudden cardiac death is extremely rare, but if you are concerned, please speak to your doctor. This is especially important if you have a family history of cardiac problems or unexplained collapses. Often, there are no preceding symptoms but there does appear to be a link in some athletes who experience fainting or near fainting during exercise. If this is the case or you are concerned please see your doctor for advice.</p>\r\n<p>For nearly all individuals, regular exercise is very beneficial to the health of the heart, resulting in better heart health. However, as illustrated by Hannah&rsquo;s story and those of athletes who suffer sudden cardiac death, heart disease can affect the young as well, so it is important to be aware of the signs and symptoms.</p>",

When to worry about spots on the penis</h1>\r\n<p>Spots, lumps and bumps on the penis can cause embarrassment and, for a minority of men, health and sexual function issues. We ask two specialists how blemishes on the penis are treated, what is common and what is not, and why it is important to visit a GP or sexual clinic if in doubt.</p>\r\n<p>The news that men are extremely attached to their penises, literally and emotionally, will come as no surprise to either gender.</p>\r\n<p>A man's sense of masculinity is often linked to his sexual organ. Unsightly blemishes down there - particularly those that are sexually transmitted - can not only be damaging to a guy's vanity but, for the unlucky few, their long-term health.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Lumps and bumps</h2>\r\n<p>The good news is the majority of lumps that appear on the penis are both normal and harmless.</p>\r\n<p>\"Men often worry about spots, pimples, rashes, lumps or bumps, but remember, spots and pimples can be a normal part of a person's anatomy,\" says Karin O'Sullivan, clinical lead at the sexual health charity<a href=\"https://www.fpa.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">&nbsp;fpa</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Among the most common are the wonderfully alliterative pearly penile papules, small flesh-coloured lumps that tend to circle the head of the penis in one or two rows - these are just a normal part of your penis and can't be caught or passed on.</p>\r\n<p>Occasionally, similar-looking papules may have a belly button-like dimple in the top and be scattered across the penis - these are more likely to be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/doctor/molluscum-contagiosum-pro\">molluscum contagiosum</a>&nbsp;instead.</p>\r\n<p>Most prevalent in young boys, these are caused by a relative of the wart virus and your body will get rid of them on its own. However, be sure to wash your hands after touching them as they could be passed on to other parts of the body or to other people.</p>\r\n<p>Fordyce Spots are sebaceous glands - they make a thick moisturiser-like substance for the skin but without hairs coming out of them as on other parts of the body - and manifest as small yellowish or white spots on the head or shaft of the penis.</p>\r\n<p>They may appear more alarming, but, again, fret not - up to 95% of adult men have them and they don't generally require any treatment.</p>\r\n<p>A lymphocele - a hard lump that appears after sex or masturbating - can seem even more worrying, not least because it's usually self-inflicted.</p>\r\n<p>No worries; this swelling caused by a temporary blockage of lymph channels that drain away clear lymph fluid (important in immunity) usually goes away in no time at all and won't cause any permanent problems.</p>\r\n<h2>A spot of bother</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://patient.info/sexual-health/chlamydia\">Chlamydia</a>, warts and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/sexual-health/sexually-transmitted-infections-leaflet/gonorrhoea\">gonorrhoea&nbsp;</a>are the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and, of these,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/sexual-health/sexually-transmitted-infections-leaflet/anogenital-warts\">genital warts</a>&nbsp;are the most common in the UK. They look like small fleshy lumps, sometimes with a cauliflower-shaped surface, and appear on their own or in crops.</p>\r\n<p>Genital warts usually disappear on their own in time but you can pass them on to others,via sexual contact so, guys, be responsible and use a condom to prevent transmission. They can also be treated with special creams or paints, or even 'burned' off with a laser/liquid nitrogen - nerve-wracking, sure, but relatively painless.</p>\r\n<p>Long-term, doctors hope that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/childrens-health/immunisation/human-papillomavirus-immunisation-hpv\">human papillomavirus</a>&nbsp;(HPV) vaccination being given to girls will be extended to boys, which will not only reduce cervical cancer rates but also genital warts.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes a crop of painful blisters or red spots can appear on the penis or groin, which could be indicative of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/sexual-health/sexually-transmitted-infections-leaflet/genital-herpes\">genital herpes</a>. Be proactive and seek medical advice as early as you can - doctors will most likely prescribe tablets to reduce the length of the flare and advise about how to prevent passing the herpes simplex virus on.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://patient.info/mens-health/penis-problems/peyronies-disease\">Peyronie's disease</a>&nbsp;describes a hard lump (called a plaque) that develops on one side of the penis shaft, causing it to bend when erect and interfering with penetration or achieving an erection.</p>\r\n<p>Peyronie's can be caused by aggressive sex or masturbation and is often more difficult to treat - shockwave therapy or even an operation are two options.</p>\r\n<p>\"Guys often come to me with pearly penile papules, but more commonly I'm getting more and more young men coming to me with Peyronie's,\" says Dr Anand Patel, a specialist in sexual function. \"This may be related to more aggressive sex and/or masturbating since pornography has been around.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>What types of spots and pimples on the penis can be a sign of something more serious?</h2>\r\n<p>\"Ulcers or lumps - other than pearly penile papules - that won't go away should be checked out,\" advises Patel. \"A single painless ulcer, or chancre, can be the first presentation of early&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/sexual-health/syphilis\">syphilis</a>&nbsp;and will require antibiotics. If you've got a lump (usually on the head of the penis) that's not going away or is getting bigger, please do get it checked out, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/mens-health/penis-problems/penile-cancer\">penile cancer</a>&nbsp;is an uncommon possibility.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>If in doubt, get it checked out</h2>\r\n<p>So guys, if you are worried about spots or pimples on your penis, don't waste time worrying unnecessarily - make an appointment with a GP or sexual health clinic and put your mind at rest.</p>\r\n<p>\"People sometimes avoid getting checked because they're embarrassed, or just hope any problem will go away,\" says O'Sullivan. \"But it's often easier to treat a problem if it's identified early, and if it's something more serious it means you can be referred urgently.</p>\r\n<p>\"And if it isn't anything to worry about, at least then you'll know for sure!\"</p>\r\n<p>Patel concurs: \"If you've read this and you're still not clear, then please go and get checked out either at your GP or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic, where you'll see doctors and nurses who see this sort of problem many times a day!\" he says.</p>\r\n<p>\"The earlier you see us, the sooner we can ease your concerns or get you some treatment.\"</p>",

                            Content = "<h1 class=\"articleHeader__title\">How to find the right treatment for your hay fever</h1>\r\n<p>For many people across the UK, the arrival of spring is a mixed blessing. No sooner have they shaken off the winter gloom, than they're hit with the onset of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/allergies-blood-immune/hay-fever-leaflet\">hay fever</a>&nbsp;season. Characterised by a streaming nose and itchy eyes, the condition can range in severity from annoying to debilitating.</p>\r\n<p>In actuality, 'hay fever season' is a bit of a misnomer - it all depends on what kind of pollen you're allergic to. According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/pollen-forecast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Met Office</a>, tree pollen season classically runs from late March to mid-May, grass pollen season from mid-May to July, and weed pollen season from June until September. (Despite what TS Eliot may have said, the cruellest month will vary from person to person.)</p>\r\n<p>Of course, hay fever is a misery whenever it occurs, with potential to spoil what would otherwise be a blissful day outside.</p>\r\n<p>\"Hay fever is also called allergic rhinitis or seasonal rhinitis,\" says Holly Shaw, nurse advisor at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.allergyuk.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Allergy UK</a>. \"The majority of hay fever sufferers are affected by grass pollen, but there are different types of pollen that can cause hay fever depending on the time of the year.\"</p>\r\n<p>As an atopic (allergic) condition, it is caused by the body's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/allergies-blood-immune/immune-system-diseases\">immune system&nbsp;</a>overreacting to pollen in the air. The condition can affect anyone of any age, often making its first appearance during childhood or the teenage years. Overall, as many as 1 in 5 Brits are affected.</p>\r\n<p>\"Hay fever commonly affects the nasal passages and the eyes, and has symptoms not dissimilar to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/chest-lungs/cough-leaflet/common-cold-upper-respiratory-tract-infections\">common cold</a>, which is often where patients become confused,\" says Shaw. \"But hay fever is more persistent and has an element of itchiness you may not get with a cold.\"</p>\r\n<h2>Start with antihistamines</h2>\r\n<p>For many hay fever sufferers, a first line of defence is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/allergies-blood-immune/allergies/antihistamines\">antihistamines</a>, which work by blocking the action of histamine (one of the compounds involved in allergic reactions). These come as a nasal spray or a tablet and can be picked up from your pharmacy without a prescription.</p>\r\n<p>If your hay fever is mild, it may be enough to take an antihistamine pill as and when you notice symptoms. You could also consider taking them as a preventative measure on days when the pollen count is high.</p>\r\n<p>Although older types of antihistamine (eg, chlorphenamine, hydroxyzine and promethazine) have a reputation for causing drowsiness, the newer antihistamines (eg, cetirizine, loratadine and fexofenadine) typically lack this side effect.</p>\r\n<p>\"The older generation style of antihistamines is not ideal for those who need to be alert for driving, work etc, so daily non-sedating antihistamines are a good choice of treatment,\" says Shaw. \"Community pharmacists are well placed to give advice and further guidance on which preparations would be suitable for an individual.\"</p>\r\n<h2>Talk to your pharmacist</h2>\r\n<p>She strongly recommends talking to a pharmacist first, to help you target the specific area that's a problem and avoid contra-indications with other medicines.</p>\r\n<p>\"For example, you may or may not have itchy watery red eyes, but if you do have that issue then the use of an eye drop may be effective,\" she says. \"If the nose symptoms are a particular problem then the use of a nasal spray containing an antihistamine or steroid may be advised. It's also really important that you're shown how to use your nasal spray or eye drops because the medicine will only be effective if you know how to use it.\"</p>\r\n<p>There are further treatment options too, such as a nasal allergen balm that can be applied to the outside of the nostrils, preventing pollen from entering the airways. You may also be encouraged to try nasal saline douching - ie using a special preparation to rinse out inflamed nasal passages.</p>\r\n<p>\"We're all individuals, and everyone's going to have their own set of circumstances and symptoms,\" says Shaw. \"Hay fever can be mild, moderate or severe, so it's important to treat symptom severity appropriately.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>When to see the GP</h2>\r\n<p>If you find your symptoms getting worse, or they don&rsquo;t respond to pharmacy medicines, it may be worth visiting your GP. In very severe cases, you might be prescribed a short course of steroids or be referred for immunotherapy.</p>\r\n<p>With immunotherapy, small amounts of pollen are introduced to your system, either via an injection or via a tablet that dissolves under your tongue. Over time, you build up resistance to the pollen, greatly reducing the severity of your symptoms.</p>\r\n<p>The catch here is that it takes a very long time to take effect. In a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5479315/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">major study</a>&nbsp;published last year, researchers found that, while the treatment is highly effective, it needs to be given for at least three years in order to have an impact. It isn't suitable for everyone - and it certainly isn't suitable as a short-term fix.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Other strategies</h2>\r\n<p>In terms of natural remedies for hay fever, the jury's out on whether they actually make a difference. Many people swear by a spoonful of honey (although there's no clinical evidence to support its use), while others gravitate towards a range of herbs and supplements.</p>\r\n<p>Some of these remedies may prove beneficial - for instance,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.allergologyinternational.com/article/S1323-8930(14)00010-0/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">fish oil might have a protective effect</a>&nbsp;against inflammatory conditions like hay fever, and it has been suggested that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2117278/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">eating a Mediterranean diet may reduce allergic symptoms</a>. (Of course, a generally healthy diet is never a bad idea, irrespective of whether it helps your hay fever.)</p>\r\n<p>Less contentious are the lifestyle changes you can make to minimise your exposure to pollen. Through monitoring the pollen forecasts, you can make an informed decision about when to go outside and what kind of preventative measures to take.</p>\r\n<p>\"If you know the pollen count's going to be high next week, you could start using your treatments early, to build up a preventative effect,\" says Shaw. \"Pollen is at its highest early in the morning and late in the evening, so you may want to avoid going outside during those times.\"</p>\r\n<p>For instance, if you enjoy running in the park, you might want to give that a miss on high pollen count days, and go to the gym instead. It's also wise to avoid alcohol (as many drinks contain histamine) and to cover up your eyes and hair - for instance, by wearing hats and wraparound sunglasses.</p>\r\n<p>\"It's important to have a shower or wash your face when you come in from outside, so as not to transfer pollen on to bedding,\" adds Shaw. \"Other sensible measures include closing windows and doors and fitting a pollen filter in your car.\"</p>\r\n<p>The main thing is to know your own body and your own triggers. That way, your local pharmacist (or perhaps your GP) can point you in the direction of a treatment that's right for you.</p>",

There's no guaranteed cure; while in some cases it settles on its own, it's usually treated with medication or surgery. However, some women claim that adopting an endometriosis diet by eating or avoiding certain foods can help reduce endometriosis symptoms. So what's the truth?</p>\r\n<h2>Can endometriosis be cured by diet?</h2>\r\n<p>If you suffer from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/womens-health/pelvic-pain-in-women/endometriosis\">endometriosis</a>, a condition that can cause agonisingly painful periods and difficulty getting pregnant, it's understandable to wonder if changing your lifestyle or adopting an endometriosis diet could help. Current endometriosis treatments, which include surgery and hormonal medication, can be invasive and have unpleasant side effects. It's no wonder many women with endometriosis pin their hopes on alternative solutions, from acupuncture to avoiding certain foods.</p>\r\n<p>Georgina, 27, from Surrey, was diagnosed with endometriosis six years ago and has had numerous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/treatment-medication/laparoscopy-and-laparoscopic-surgery\">surgeries</a>&nbsp;to help control the condition. She says: \"After my latest surgery, I was told that changing my diet - in particular, giving up dairy products, alcohol and gluten - might help my endometriosis symptoms. But I didn't necessarily want to give up the foods I love if there's no evidence that it would actually help.\"</p>\r\n<p>There are countless blogs online by women who claim their endometriosis symptoms disappeared after changing their diets. Such information can undoubtedly offer hope to those facing devastating pain and infertility - but are these stories too good to be true?</p>\r\n<p>Komal Kumar, senior dietitian at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ivf.org.uk/treatments/lister-fertility-dietetic-clinic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Lister Fertility Clinic</a>, part of HCA UK, cautions that so far the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.viamedica.pl/ginekologia_polska/article/view/47748\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">evidence for a link</a>&nbsp;between certain foods and endometriosis is inconclusive. And even if there is a connection, it's likely diet is only one piece of the puzzle.</p>\r\n<p>\"It's only recently research has started to show a potential link between endometriosis and diet,\" she explains. \"But it's important to note that such research refers to how diet can play a role in the management of endometriosis symptoms, rather than as a treatment for endometriosis altogether.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Is a low FODMAP good for endometriosis?</h2>\r\n<p>Women with endometriosis who are perhaps most likely to benefit from a dietary change, Kumar reveals, are those who also suffer from digestive conditions such as<a href=\"https://patient.info/digestive-health/irritable-bowel-syndrome-leaflet\">&nbsp;IBS</a>&nbsp;- which can cause abdominal pain, bloating and constipation or diarrhoea.</p>\r\n<p>She points to<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28303579\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">&nbsp;a recent study</a>&nbsp;which found 72% of a group of women who had both endometriosis and IBS reported an improvement in symptoms after trialling a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/news-and-features/fibre-food-and-gut-bacteria\">low FODMAP diet.</a></p>\r\n<p>\"I believe this is a massive breakthrough for women who suffer with other conditions related to their endometriosis, as through dietary management women have the opportunity to greatly improve their quality of life and reduce the burden of their conditions.\"</p>\r\n<h2>What are the downsides of diet changes</h2>\r\n<p>Saying that, Kumar acknowledges that the low FODMAP diet is very restrictive. She certainly wouldn't advise every woman with endometriosis to start following it.</p>\r\n<p>\"It's vital that if someone with endometriosis is looking to make dietary changes, they seek the expert opinion of a qualified dietitian first, who can provide the latest credible evidence-based information. Without this, the patient could be at risk of developing nutritional deficiencies and other negative side effects such as rapid weight loss or gain.\"</p>\r\n<p>This is particularly important for women who are trying to conceive, she explains. If you're&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/pregnancy/planning-to-become-pregnant\">planning a pregnancy&nbsp;</a>and looking to change to an endometriosis diet, approach the change cautiously and ensure you're getting the nutrients you need before and after conception.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Does going gluten-free help with endometriosis symptoms?</h2>\r\n<p>Some women claim their symptoms of improve on a gluten-free diet. But should Georgina follow suit? Kumar says not necessarily.</p>\r\n<p>She confirms that some women have found their endometriosis symptoms improve when they cut out certain foods, but what works for one woman, won't work for everyone.</p>\r\n<p>There&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23334113\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">was a study</a>&nbsp;conducted on patients with severe endometriosis in 2012, which found 75% of participants noticed an improvement on a year-long gluten-free diet. But the study itself only followed a small amount of women. More research is needed before we know if giving up wheat is truly beneficial in this scenario.</p>\r\n<p>\"There is no specific diet for endometriosis management, and it is impossible to say what women should restrict or should include with their diet as everyone is different,\" Kumar stresses. \"It is so important not to restrict certain food groups or nutrients, such as gluten, unless you have been medically diagnosed as having an intolerance or condition such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/digestive-health/coeliac-disease-leaflet\">coeliac disease</a>, as this can deprive the body of vital nutrients.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>How to eat well with endometriosis</h2>\r\n<p>For most women with endometriosis, Kumar says the best bet is simply to follow a healthy, balanced diet. She points to Public Health England's Eatwell Guide - a resource which shows how much of what we eat overall should come from each food group. You can find more tips on following this method in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/healthy-living/healthy-eating\">healthy eating leaflet</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\"This is based on consuming a balanced diet of carbohydrates, fats and proteins, with women aiming for 2,000 calories per day, unless they are specifically looking to gain or lose weight under the close guidance of a dietician.\"</p>\r\n<p>And remember, while eating certain foods won't necessarily improve endometriosis, it never hurts to eat healthily. Plus, a nutritious diet is also important for preventing potential future health issues such as obesity,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/heart-health/high-blood-pressure-hypertension\">high blood pressure</a>, type 2 diabetes and heart disease.</p>\r\n<p>For women looking to conceive, it's advised to take 400 mg of folic acid per day, Kumar explains. And consuming foods rich in folate - such as spinach, kale and broccoli - is also a good idea.<br /><br />\"Following a good nutrition plan can help to regulate ovulation cycles affected by weight, improve the health of a woman's eggs, improve the success of assisted reproduction therapies such as IVF treatment, and improve chances of bringing a healthy baby to full term,\" she adds.</p>",

A bit of rest, plenty of fluids, taking paracetamol and perhaps a little honey and lemon are usually all it takes to see off a cold - without a visit to the GP.</p>\r\n<p>But if a cough lingers for longer than usual, or we feel particularly unwell, we may start to wonder if we've developed a chest infection. Unlike colds,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/chest-infection\">chest infections</a>&nbsp;may need additional treatment, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/antibiotics-leaflet\">antibiotics</a>&nbsp;in the case of bacterial infections such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/pneumonia-leaflet\">pneumonia</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>I've been coughing for weeks</h2>\r\n<p>Whilst a persistent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/cough-leaflet\">cough</a>&nbsp;can be troublesome, having symptoms that last over two weeks - and even coughing up mucus - does not necessarily indicate a problem. \"Viral coughs can last up to three weeks,\" explains GP&nbsp;<a href=\"http://uberhealthblog.com/about-julie-coffey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Dr Julie Coffey</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\"Many people think if you cough up a little bit of mucus you've got an infection, but this is not necessarily the case,\" explains Coffey. \"But during a common cold the larger tubes in the airways become inflamed, and they produce more mucus than normal. Coughing up mucus that is clear, yellow or even green can be a normal part of a viral cough.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h3>Warning signs</h3>\r\n<p>If you are coughing up more mucus than you have with previous coughs, or are suffering&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/chest-pain-leaflet\">chest pain</a>&nbsp;as a result of persistent coughing, it may be time to see your GP.</p>\r\n<p>\"With a chest infection, you cough much more mucus up,\" agrees Coffey. \"With a bacterial infection, this can be yellow, green, or a darker colour.\" If you cough up blood or rusty-coloured sputum, you should definitely see a doctor.</p>\r\n<p>\"Patents may also experience chest pain, difficulty breathing or a rapid heart-rate.\"</p>\r\n<h2>I have a fever</h2>\r\n<p>Feeling hot?&nbsp; Having a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/fever-and-night-sweats-leaflet\">fever</a>&nbsp;can be a normal part of having a cold and is not necessarily a sign of an infection. However, if you're working up a sweat, it's definitely worth taking and recording your temperature regularly.</p>\r\n<h3>Warning signs</h3>\r\n<p>\"With a viral cough, you often have a fever which tends to go up and down,\" explains Coffey. \"With a bacterial infection, such as pneumonia, you tend to have a consistently high fever - usually around 38-40&deg;C.\"</p>\r\n<p>If your fever remains persistently high, it's worth giving your GP a call.</p>\r\n<h2>I feel terrible!</h2>\r\n<p>Common colds can vary in their severity; whilst sometimes we can struggle on, a bad dose might see us stretched out on the sofa for a couple of days. If we feel particularly bad, we may start to worry that something is wrong.</p>\r\n<p>\"Of course, you will feel unwell with a cold - but not seriously unwell. If you have a chest infection, you'll feel significantly worse than you have in the past,\" explains Coffey.</p>\r\n<h3>Warning signs</h3>\r\n<p>\"Patients who come to see me with an infection often know there's something wrong with them, as they feel much worse than they have with previous coughs and colds.\"</p>\r\n<p>As well as feeling dreadful, patients with chest infection can feel \"a bit drowsy, almost confused in their thinking,\" explains Coffey. \"These symptoms would set alarm bells ringing.\"</p>\r\n<h2>I look dreadful!</h2>\r\n<p>A red nose, cold sores, chapped lips and a pale complexion often accompany a cold - and nobody looks their best when they've been up all night coughing. So can looking ill really be a sign that we need to see our GP?</p>\r\n<h3>Warning signs</h3>\r\n<p>\"Doctors can often tell when a patient has pneumonia when they see you in the waiting room,\" explains Coffey. \"You tend to look more unwell than you have before - the difference is often quite stark. Those around you will also be able to see how unwell you are.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"If you have a bluish tinge to your lips or extremities, this can also be a concern.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>I'm in pain</h2>\r\n<p>Coughs and colds are often accompanied by headaches, sore throats and feelings of general malaise. \"With a cold, or a flu-like illness, you can experience muscle aches,\" explains Dr Kenny Livingstone, GP and founder of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.zoomdoc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ZoomDoc</a>. \"These can usually be managed with paracetamol.\"</p>\r\n<p>However, pain can also be a sign that we&rsquo;ve developed a chest infection, so how can we tell the difference?</p>\r\n<h3>Warning signs</h3>\r\n<p>\"Although we suffer aches and pains as part of a cold, if the pain is severe or you are out of breath, this may be a sign that something is wrong,\" explains Coffey.</p>\r\n<p>\"Patients with a chest infection will often present with chest pain,\" says Livingstone. \"This can also be accompanied by a feeling of 'tightness' or shortness of breath.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Am I at risk?</h2>\r\n<p>Whilst coughs and colds abound, particularly during the winter months, the chances of a fit and healthy person contracting a chest infection are minimal. \"Generally, if you are a reasonably healthy person with no pre-existing problems, the chances are it will be a normal cough. For these, you don't need to visit your doctor or take antibiotics,\" says Coffey.</p>\r\n<p>However, there are certain groups who are at greater risk. \"If you have a weakened immune system, are very young, elderly or seriously overweight, you have an increased risk of pneumonia,\" explains Coffey. People with long-term lung conditions, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/chest-lungs/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-leaflet\">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a>&nbsp;(COPD)<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-leaflet\">,</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/chest-lungs/asthma-leaflet\">asthma</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/chest-lungs/bronchiectasis-leaflet\">bronchiectasis</a>, are at particular risk of problems.</p>\r\n<p>Those who have compromised&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/immune-suppression/immune-system\">immunity</a>&nbsp;should take up the offer of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/medicine/influenza-vaccine\">flu vaccine</a>, to reduce their risk of infection. \"A chest infection often starts with a flu-like illness,\" explains Livingstone. \"The flu vaccine targets the most likely virus strain. So, if you reduce your risk of getting flu, you'll reduce your risk of a chest infection.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"If you're pregnant, or in an at-risk group, it's a good idea to have the vaccine.\"</p>\r\n<h2>I think I have a chest infection - what should I do?</h2>\r\n<p>Coffey recommends that the first port of call should always be your GP, even when symptoms are severe. \"I'd always try the GP in the first instance,\" she says. \"If you explain the symptoms fully to a receptionist, you should get through fairly quickly.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Even if hospitalisation is needed, your GP will be able to help to get you seen more speedily on arrival.\"</p>\r\n<p>Depending on the type and severity of your chest infection, and your overall general health, your GP will often prescribe antibiotics. \"In the case of a bacterial infection, we'd usually give 5-7 days of antibiotics for a patient who was previously fit and well,\" explains Coffey. \"Someone with lung disease might be given 10-14 days.\"</p>\r\n<p>In the case of a viral chest infection, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/acute-bronchitis\">bronchitis</a>, antibiotics are not usually prescribed if a patient was in previously good health.</p>\r\n<p>\"Those with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/asthma-leaflet\">asthma</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-leaflet\">COPD</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/cystic-fibrosis-leaflet\">cystic fibrosis</a>&nbsp;will often need antibiotics and steroid inhalers and sometimes nebulisers,\" adds Livingstone.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Where can I get advice?</h2>\r\n<p>If you want some general advice, or are unsure about your symptoms the first port of call could also be a pharmacist. \"Pharmacists are trained to advise you on managing your symptoms,\" says Livingstone. \"They are also used to recognising the signs of chest infection. If you're unsure, they can be a good place to start.\"</p>",

That's particularly true when it comes to unexplained medical symptoms, especially if they're a bit embarrassing to discuss.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It's vital to be aware of changes to your body: whether that's a lump that's appeared, changes to your bowel habits, or a bloated tummy that you've experienced for weeks. Don't just ignore them and hope they'll go away.</p>\r\n<p>Because where&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/cancer/cancer\">cancer&nbsp;</a>is concerned, 'going away' is not going to happen. More importantly, the earlier you're diagnosed and treated, the less extreme your treatment is likely to be and the better your chances of long-term survival.</p>\r\n<p>Clare Hyde, health information officer at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Cancer Research UK</a>, says: \"With a long list of possible signs and symptoms it can be hard to remember what might or might not be cancer. That's why we encourage people to know their bodies and what is normal for them. If you do notice a change or something that doesn't seem right - whatever it is - it's important to tell your doctor. It probably won't be cancer but, if it is, catching it early means that treatment is much more likely to be successful, giving you a better chance of beating the disease.\"</p>\r\n<p>Here are some of the signs it's particularly important to let your doctor know about:</p>\r\n<h2>Blood in your poo</h2>\r\n<p>If you've experienced a change in your bowel habit or blood in your poo for more than three weeks, you should see your GP. Looser or more frequent poos are a particular concern. Now, while we all do it, pooing is the last thing most of us want to read about over our breakfast cup of tea. But we ignore possible<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/Cancer-of-the-Bowel.htm\">&nbsp;bowel cancer symptoms</a>&nbsp;at our peril.</p>\r\n<p>If you do have bowel cancer (and it's the second most common cancer killer in the UK), burying your head in the sand is guaranteed not to make it go away. And getting it diagnosed early hugely increases your chance of successful treatment.</p>\r\n<h2>Bloating</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://patient.info/digestive-health/irritable-bowel-syndrome-leaflet/wind-gas-and-bloating\">Bloating</a>&nbsp;is a common but annoying symptom that usually goes away by itself. We're talking here about persistent bloating - not the kind that comes on after a big meal and settles in an hour or two. If you've been feeling bloated on 12 days or more in the last month, go to your doctor. It's probably nothing serious, but it could be a sign of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/cancer/gynaecological-cancer/ovarian-cancer\">ovarian cancer</a>. It could also be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/digestive-health/irritable-bowel-syndrome-leaflet\">IBS</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/womens-health/periods-and-period-problems/premenstrual-syndrome\">premenstrual syndrome</a>, but don't self-diagnose.</p>\r\n<p>Annwen Jones, chief executive of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.targetovariancancer.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Target Ovarian Cancer</a>, says: \"The symptoms of ovarian cancer include persistent bloating, always feeling full, tummy pain, and needing to wee more. If you're experiencing any of these symptoms regularly, and they are not normal for you, it is important that you see your GP.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"It's unlikely that your symptoms are caused by a serious problem, but getting checked out by your GP is important, and will put your mind at rest.

It almost always isn't, but if your cough doesn't settle or you're coughing up blood or having&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/breathlessness-and-breathing-difficulties-dyspnoea\">difficulty breathing</a>, you should always see a doctor.</p>\r\n<p>The&nbsp;National Institute for Health and Care Excellence&nbsp;(NICE) recommends you should be referred for an urgent chest X-ray if you're over 40 and have two or more of these symptoms with no other explanation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Cough</li>\r\n<li>Tiredness</li>\r\n<li>Shortness of breath</li>\r\n<li>Chest pain</li>\r\n<li>Weight loss</li>\r\n<li>Appetite loss</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you're a smoker (or ex-smoker) over 40 and have just one of these symptoms, you should be referred for an urgent chest X-ray.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Lumps and bumps</h2>\r\n<p>Finding a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/womens-health/breast-problems/breast-lumps\">lump in your breast&nbsp;</a>can cause a lot of anxiety. It's unlikely to be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/cancer/breast-cancer-leaflet\">breast cancer&nbsp;</a>- there are many other causes of breast lumps - but it's always worth getting checked out.</p>\r\n<p>\"There's no right or wrong way to check your breasts - it's about looking and feeling regularly so any changes can be spotted quickly. The sooner breast cancer is diagnosed, the more effective treatment may be,\" says Samia al Qadhi, chief executive of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Breast Cancer Care</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\"Being aware of all the signs and symptoms of breast cancer is crucial - it's not just a lump to look out for. Other changes could be a nipple becoming inverted, discharge from one nipple or a change in texture of the skin. While most symptoms won't mean breast cancer, if you notice anything unusual for you get it checked out by your GP.\"</p>\r\n<p>Similarly, men should&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/news-and-features/getting-to-know-your-testicles\">check their testicles</a>&nbsp;regularly. If you notice a change in size or weight of a testicle, or any swelling or tender spots, see your doctor. Doctors are used to examining breasts and genitals. So don't be embarrassed. They've honestly seen it all before.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Bleeding after menopause</h2>\r\n<p>Bleeding from anywhere is scary, and vaginal bleeding once you thought 'that sort of thing' had stopped for good can be especially worrying. In fact, there's a good chance your doctor can reassure you - but you do need to get it checked out.</p>\r\n<p>Doctors call postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) any bleeding more than 12 months after a woman's last period if she is over the age of about 50. If you're taking&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt\">hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</a>&nbsp;you may get regular periods, but check with your GP if you get significant bleeding more than four weeks after you stop HRT.</p>\r\n<p>Every woman worries&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/what-is-cancer\">about cancer</a>, but about 90% who have PMB can be reassured on testing that there's no sinister cause. Your doctor will need to rule out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/uterine-endometrial-cancer\">cancer of the womb lining</a>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/cervical-cancer-leaflet\">cancer of the cervix</a>. Some women have a polyp - a small, non-cancerous growth from the womb lining. Many others get PMB because of inflammation of the vaginal lining, caused by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/womens-health/menopause/vaginal-dryness-atrophic-vaginitis\">vaginal dryness</a>&nbsp;after the menopause.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Persistent heartburn</h2>\r\n<p>Most people who suffer heartburn, bloating, feeling sick and/or an acid taste in the back of the throat have simple&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/acid-reflux-and-oesophagitis\">inflammation of the oesophagus (oesophagitis</a>) to blame for their discomfort. Likewise, burning pain in the top of your stomach in the middle, sometimes associated with bloating, nausea and wind, is most commonly down to inflammation of the stomach lining, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/dyspepsia-indigestion\">gastritis</a>.</p>\r\n<p>But if these symptoms are associated with vomiting after eating, food sticking as you try to swallow it, weight loss, pain in the front or back of the chest as you swallow, or loss of appetite, it's essential to rule out a more sinister cause.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://patient.info/health/oesophageal-cancer-leaflet\">Cancer of the oesophagus</a>&nbsp;affects just over 8,000 people a year in the UK and most of them are over 50.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/stomach-gastric-cancer\">Stomach cancer</a>&nbsp;is less common in the UK than in some other countries. But the number of people affected is rising. Getting a diagnosis and treatment early can make all the difference to your chances of long-term survival.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Changes to a mole</h2>\r\n<p>See your doctor if you develop an abnormal patch of skin or a change in appearance of a mole to rule out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/cancer/skin-cancer-types\">skin cancer</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Get to know your body and look of the normal moles or marks so that you will know if there has been any change. In particular, if you notice any change in the size, shape or colour of an existing mole, or if a new dark area of skin develops, see your doctor.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Unexplained weight loss</h2>\r\n<p>In most cancer cases, other symptoms will be apparent before any weight loss occurs. But occasionally&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/weight-loss-unintentional\">unintentional weight loss&nbsp;</a>is the first symptom patients notice of multiple types of cancer.</p>\r\n<p>Besides cancer, if you've lost a significant amount of weight without meaning to, you should see your doctor who might test you for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/diabetes/type-2-diabetes\">type 2 diabetes</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/mental-health/depression-leaflet\">depression</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/hormones/overactive-thyroid-gland-hyperthyroidism\">hyperthyroidism</a>.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>If you don't get referred</h2>\r\n<p>It's important to remember that if your GP decided you don't need investigating, it will usually be for very good reasons, and they should be happy to explain them to you. If I referred every patient who ever came to see me worried about cancer, I would probably swamp my hospital's entire cancer services single-handedly. I'm often able to reassure patients that their symptoms are due to a minor cause, but that's not always the case. And if I don't hear about your symptoms, that's a conversation we can't have.</p>",

Depending on your particular circumstances, this problem should be easy enough to fix. But if you're feeling truly exhausted, and can't pin it on any obvious cause, the situation might require a bit more attention.</p>\r\n<p>As Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.rcgp.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Royal College of GPs</a>, explains: \"Feeling tired after a long and busy day can affect all of us from time to time and is a natural response to pushing ourselves hard. This can often be rectified by getting a good night's sleep, eating well, and keeping hydrated. But it's important to be aware of the difference between normal tiredness, which is very common, and abnormal fatigue.\"</p>\r\n<p>If you have the kind of tiredness that doesn&rsquo;t go away, even after a good night's sleep, it may be worth investigating the situation more closely. This is especially the case if you're experiencing other symptoms, have been tired for more than four weeks, or think you might have an underlying condition.</p>\r\n<p>\"If a patient has been experiencing a prolonged lack of energy for no apparent reason, they should seek advice from a healthcare professional,\" says Professor Stokes-Lampard.</p>\r\n<p>Patient's clinical director&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/authors/dr-sarah-jarvis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr Sarah Jarvis&nbsp;</a>agrees. \"Tiredness isn't a disease, it's a symptom - and one we've all suffered at some point. There may be an obvious cause, like jet lag or disturbed nights. But if your tiredness doesn't settle or is affecting your life, it's worth getting it checked,\" she says.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Psychological causes</h2>\r\n<p>Excessive tiredness is something that strikes many of us every once in a while. According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/problemsanddisorders/tiredness.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Royal College of Psychiatrists</a>, one in five people feel unusually tired at any given time, and one in ten have prolonged fatigue.</p>\r\n<p>Often, the causes are psychological, which is not to say the exhaustion is somehow 'all in your head'. Rather, if you're going through a particularly stressful period, be that a house move or a hectic time at work, you'll often feel drained as a result.</p>\r\n<p>For one thing, you may not be sleeping as well as normal. For another, if you're under stress, your body goes into 'fight or flight' mode, sparking up a series of hormonal and physiological changes. If this stress response is activated frequently, you may end up feeling fatigued.</p>\r\n<p>Some alternative medicine practitioners attribute this kind of tiredness to '<a href=\"https://patient.info/hormones/adrenal-fatigue\">adrenal fatigue</a>'&nbsp;- ie an inability to produce the amount of adrenaline you need. This is not a proven medical condition, however, and you should steer clear of remedies that promise to cure it.</p>\r\n<p>Although some life stress is unavoidable, it's particularly important to seek help if you think you may be suffering with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/mental-health/anxiety\">anxiety</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/mental-health/depression-leaflet\">depression</a>&nbsp;or another mental health condition like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/mental-health/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-leaflet\">PTSD</a>. These conditions are often accompanied with fatigue, as well as sleep problems like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/mental-health/insomnia-poor-sleep\">insomnia</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\"Of course there is no simple blood test or scan to diagnose&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/search.asp?searchterm=depression&amp;searchcoll=All\">depression</a>. However, if you've also been feeling down, depressed or hopeless, or haven't been enjoying life as much as you were, depression could lie at the root of your tiredness,\" points out Jarvis.</p>\r\n<p>Some people feel caught in a vicious circle, in which their depression exacerbates their insomnia and their insomnia exacerbates their depression. Although there can be a temptation to self-medicate with alcohol, it's best to steer clear as this can make both problems worse.</p>\r\n<h2>Physical causes</h2>\r\n<p>There can be physical causes for 'TATT' too, although they're less common than the psychological ones.</p>\r\n<p>\"A prolonged state of lethargy can sometimes be a symptom of a serious underlying condition, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/diabetes/type-2-diabetes\">type 2 diabetes</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/digestive-health/coeliac-disease-leaflet\">coeliac disease</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/allergies-blood-immune/anaemia-leaflet\">anaemia</a>,&rdquo; says Stokes-Lampard. \"Patients are rarely fatigued in isolation, and will often experience other symptoms. For example, with respect to coeliac disease, patients might also feel bloated or have diarrhoea, and experience weight loss.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"For type 2 diabetes, along with tiredness, you may feel more thirsty, need to pass urine more often or get more minor infections like boils or recurrent thrush,\" adds Jarvis.</p>\r\n<p>Other issues that can cause fatigue are thyroid problems like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/doctor/hypothyroidism\">hypothyroidism</a>, infections such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/ears-nose-throat-mouth/sore-throat-2/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis\">glandular fever</a>, or sleep disorders like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/tiredness-fatigue/obstructive-sleep-apnoea-syndrome\">sleep apnoea</a>. If your doctor suspects any of these causes, he or she will run a physical test.</p>\r\n<p>Less commonly, you might be suffering with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/tiredness-fatigue/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-myalgic-encephalomyelitis\">chronic fatigue syndrome</a>, also known as ME, which is characterised by extreme tiredness along with symptoms such as foggy-headedness and muscle pain. Unfortunately, there is no specific test to confirm the diagnosis of ME. You'll be diagnosed only when other conditions are ruled out.</p>\r\n<p>ME can range in severity from relatively mild to extremely disabling. While most people do eventually recover, there is currently no cure, and symptoms may take a relapsing-remitting course. A related condition,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/tiredness-fatigue/fibromyalgia\">fibromyalgia</a>, can also cause chronic fatigue.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond these causes, tiredness can be a side effect of certain medications, and it is to be expected if you're currently pregnant, or have gone through surgery or chemotherapy. You're also more likely to suffer tiredness if you're very overweight (as your body has to work harder day-to-day) or underweight (as your muscles might not be very strong).</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Avoid the sugar crash</h2>\r\n<p>If you don't have an underlying condition that requires treatment, making a few lifestyle changes might be enough. To begin with, it's worth re-evaluating your diet. Steer clear of refined carbohydrates, as these provide a short-lived energy spike, followed by a crash that leaves you craving your next sugar hit.</p>\r\n<p>As Patient's nutritionist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/authors/rose-constantine-smith\">Rose Constantine Smith</a>&nbsp;explains, it's important that each meal provides a good balance of nutrients.</p>\r\n<p>\"Try to include a portion of lean protein, vegetables and a source of complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, potatoes with skins on or pulses,\" she says. \"These are broken down slowly by the body, thus providing a steady supply of energy to keep you going until your next meal. If, however, you are in need of a pick-me-up between meals, opt for natural sources of quick-release energy alongside a harder-to-digest food that will slow the release of sugar into the bloodstream.\"</p>\r\n<p>A few examples might be dried fruit with nuts; yoghurt with chopped fresh fruit; or a slice of wholegrain toast with a thin layer of peanut butter.</p>\r\n<p>\"Coffee with a splash of milk may also provide a much needed pick-me-up if you are feeling particularly tired, and drinking up to three cups of coffee a day is said to be beneficial. Try to avoid having any in the afternoon though, as this may disrupt your sleep!\" adds Rose.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Exercise and sleep</h2>\r\n<p>As well as tweaking your diet, it's also important to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/healthy-living/physical-activity-for-health\">make sure you're exercising enough</a>. This may be the last thing you feel like doing when you're exhausted, but the benefits speak for themselves. Quite aside from the endorphin hit, regular exercise improves sleep quality and gives you more stamina to get through the day.</p>\r\n<p>A word of warning though - more is not always better. So-called 'overtraining syndrome' is real, and athletes need a lot of rest in order to recover properly. Overtraining typically leads to performance plateaus, a higher risk of injury, and - most saliently - fatigue. If that's you, make sure to scale back on your workouts, or take some time off. (And avoid exercising just before bed, as that much sought-after energy boost can leave you unable to sleep!)</p>\r\n<p>One final tip is to look at your sleep itself. How is your sleep quality? Is it being compromised by, for example, afternoon energy drinks, too much&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/news-and-features/what-binge-watching-is-really-doing-to-your-heath\">screen time</a>&nbsp;before bedtime, excessive alcohol consumption, or naps at odd times? Being a bit stricter about your 'sleep hygiene' can make all the difference when it comes to increasing your energy levels.</p>\r\n<p>Although feeling tired all the time is very common, it isn't exactly 'normal', and it shouldn't be something you have to live with. Make sure to book an appointment with your GP if you've ruled out all the obvious factors and are concerned.</p>",

Most of us immediately think of heart disease when we experience it. The pain can vary from mild to severe, occasional or frequent, and can be felt on either side of the chest as well as the centre. But what causes chest pain and when should you worry?</p>\r\n<h2>Chest pain causes</h2>\r\n<p>Frustratingly for doctors and patients alike, there are a lot of things that can potentially cause chest pain.</p>\r\n<p>Dr Jeff Foster, a GP at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tfjprivategp.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Spire Parkway</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;Solihull, explains: \"<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/chest-pain-leaflet\">Chest pain&nbsp;</a>can be difficult to manage sometimes because it can be caused by several completely different parts of the body: heart, lungs, digestive system, muscles, bones and psychological conditions. Virtually all of these systems can have minor or serious conditions which can make it hard for a doctor to find the cause.\"</p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, most of the time chest pain does not have a serious cause, but it's still important to seek medical advice as soon as possible after experiencing it, explains cardiologist Dr Michael MacDonald.</p>\r\n<p>He reveals that your doctor will consider conditions like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/heart-health/angina-leaflet\">angina</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/chest-infection\">chest infection</a>, digestive conditions like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/acid-reflux-and-oesophagitis\">acid reflux</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/dyspepsia-indigestion/stomach-ulcer-gastric-ulcer\">stomach ulcers,</a><a href=\"https://patient.info/health/gallstones-and-bile\">&nbsp;gallstones</a>, inflammation of tissues around your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/chest-pain-leaflet/costochondritis\">ribs</a>&nbsp;and muscle injuries.</p>\r\n<p>\"The good thing is that most chest pain is not too serious. But it's still important you seek medical advice and let your doctor decide on the diagnosis. If you have any concern it is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/heart-health/heart-attack-myocardial-infarction-leaflet\">heart attack</a>, dial 999 [if in the UK] straightaway,\" he says.</p>\r\n<h2>When it could be serious</h2>\r\n<p>The warning signs of a<a href=\"https://patient.info/health/heart-attack-myocardial-infarction-leaflet\">&nbsp;heart attack,</a>&nbsp;explains McDonald, are: \"A sudden chest pain that may spread to your jaw, neck, arms (usually left), or back. At the same time, you may have pressure, squeezing, heaviness or tightness in your chest,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/breathlessness-and-breathing-difficulties-dyspnoea\">shortness of breath</a>, nausea and sweating. If you have these, [if in the UK] call 999 immediately.\"</p>\r\n<p>Some people's description of a heart attack is that it was \"like an elephant sitting on my chest\".</p>\r\n<h2>Heart attack in women</h2>\r\n<p>In women the symptoms of a heart attack may be less severe and many women seek medical help later than they should.</p>\r\n<p>Foster says: \"There is increasing evidence that the symptoms felt in heart attacks can differ in men and women. Women often still feel a central crushing chest pain radiating to the arm or neck, but some studies suggest that women may report this pain in a different way: as being sharp, or being located in the upper abdomen, or with back pressure. Women may also have common nonspecific symptoms such as extreme fatigue, dizziness, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/dizziness/fainting-collapse\">fainting</a>.\"</p>\r\n<h2>Angina</h2>\r\n<p>Angina is chest pain that comes from the heart. This is a common but potentially serious condition.</p>\r\n<p>There are two types of angina:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Stable angina which occurs during exercise.</li>\r\n<li>Unstable angina which occurs at any time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Foster describes angina as being a 'pre-heart attack' condition.</p>\r\n<p>\"Once the arteries are narrow to a point of nearly being blocked off, occasionally the blood supply to the heart will be compromised enough to cause chest pain which mimics a heart attack. Unstable angina is very close to a full-blown heart attack,\" he reveals.</p>\r\n<h2>How doctors investigate chest pain</h2>\r\n<p>Foster reveals that doctors use the acronym SOCRATES to help them get to the bottom of what's causing a patient's chest pain. Socrates stands for: Site, Onset, Character, Radiation, Associations, Time, Exacerbating factors and Severity.</p>\r\n<h3>Site</h3>\r\n<p>The site of the pain. Is the pain felt on the right, left or centre of your chest? If it's on the left or central, it could be due to a heart problem. If it's felt on the right, it could signal an issue with your lungs or a particular muscle.</p>\r\n<h3>Onset</h3>\r\n<p>How long you have had the pain is an important factor. Has it been there for weeks and it's getting worse (which could be linked to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/mental-health/anxiety\">anxiety</a>) or has it come on suddenly?</p>\r\n<h3>Character</h3>\r\n<p>What type of pain is it? A sharp and stabbing pain could signal lung disease or a nerve problem. While a more burning pain could be due to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/digestive-health/dyspepsia-indigestion\">indigestion</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Radiation</h3>\r\n<p>Where is the pain and does it radiate down the arm? Pain in the left arm can be linked to heart disease, whereas on the right it could be your gallbladder.</p>\r\n<h3>Association</h3>\r\n<p>Does your pain seem associated with anything like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/chest-lungs/cough-leaflet\">coughing&nbsp;</a>or anxiety?</p>\r\n<h3>Time</h3>\r\n<p>How long does the pain last? Is it worse in the morning, evening or after eating?</p>\r\n<h3>Exacerbating factors</h3>\r\n<p>Does anything help, such as over-the-counter medication?</p>\r\n<h3>Severity</h3>\r\n<p>And finally, how severe is it? A scale of 1-10 describes mild pain that comes on gradually, to severe pain.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Don't self-diagnose; see your GP</h2>\r\n<p>It's important not to self-diagnose, but you can prepare for your appointment with your doctor by thinking about these questions.</p>\r\n<p>And whichever type of chest pain you have, it's sensible to have it checked out, especially if it occurs during exercise. Make some notes about when it happens, how often you experience it, and the type of pain it is. If you are in any doubt that it could be a heart attack, if in the UK, call 999 immediately.</p>",
