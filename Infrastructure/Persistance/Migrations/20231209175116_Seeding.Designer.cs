It can be hard to know whether a poorly child has a cold or something else such as tonsillitis - an inflammation of the tonsils. So what are the signs of tonsillitis, and how can you treat it in your child?</p>\r\n<h2>What is tonsillitis?</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://patient.info/ears-nose-throat-mouth/sore-throat-2/tonsillitis\">Tonsillitis</a>&nbsp;is an inflammation of the tonsils and it's common in children, although adults and teenagers can get it too. It is normally caused by a virus, which spreads when we&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/chest-lungs/cough-leaflet\">cough</a>, sneeze, speak or are in physical contact with others. Sometimes, tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>What are the symptoms of tonsillitis in children?</h2>\r\n<p>Tonsillitis can feel like a bad&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/news-and-features/difference-between-cold-and-flu\">cold</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/infections/influenza-and-flu-like-illness\">flu</a>, but the tonsils at the back of the throat - the two round lumps - will be red and swollen. The main symptoms in children and adults are a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/ears-nose-throat-mouth/sore-throat-2\">sore throat</a>, difficulty swallowing, a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/childrens-health/fever-in-children-high-temperature\">temperature</a>&nbsp;of 38C or higher, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/chest-lungs/cough-leaflet\">cough</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/news-and-features/surprising-causes-of-headaches\">headaches</a>, feeling sick,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/ears-nose-throat-mouth/earache-ear-pain\">earache</a>&nbsp;and feeling tired.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes, the symptoms can be more severe - such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/oedema-swelling\">swollen</a>&nbsp;glands in your neck or blisters on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/news-and-features/what-do-tonsils-do\">tonsils</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>How to treat a child with tonsillitis?</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://patient.info/news-and-features/tonsillitis-treatment\">Tonsillitis</a>&nbsp;usually gets better on its own after a few days, but there are things you can do to help manage the symptoms and keep your child more comfortable.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Make sure they get plenty of rest and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/news-and-features/why-do-we-need-sleep\">sleep</a>.</li>\r\n<li>Ensure your child drinks plenty of water, which can soothe the throat and prevent dehydration.</li>\r\n<li>Encourage your child to eat soft foods, such as soups, yoghurts or mashed potatoes and cooked vegetables, which can be easier to swallow if they have a sore throat.</li>\r\n<li>You can give your child paracetamol-based medicines, such as Calpol, which can reduce a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/fever\">fever</a>&nbsp;and ease pain. You can also give them children&rsquo;s ibuprofen. It&rsquo;s important to make sure you are giving your child the correct dosage for their age or weight.</li>\r\n<li>Throat sprays may help ease sore throats, but they may not be suitable for younger children - speak to your local pharmacist about which ones that may be more suitable for your child.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>When to speak to your doctor if your child has tonsillitis</h2>\r\n<p>If your child&rsquo;s symptoms remain after four days or your child becomes more unwell, you should see your GP. You should also see your doctor if your child has pus-filled spots on their tonsils.</p>\r\n<p>Complications caused by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/ears-nose-throat-mouth/sore-throat-2/tonsillitis\">tonsillitis</a>&nbsp;are very rare but include the development of an abcess called a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/ears-nose-throat-mouth/sore-throat-2/tonsillitis\">quinsy</a>&nbsp;- a fluid-filled blister in the throat - which can make it difficult to breathe. It's important to see your doctor or go to A&amp;E if your child has difficulty breathing.</p>\r\n<p>Most children get tonsillitis which is caused by a virus, but sometimes, it can be caused by bacteria. If this is the case, they may prescribe&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/infections/antibiotics-leaflet\">antibiotics</a>. If your child is prescribed antibiotics, it's important that they finish the full course of the medication.</p>",

But can stress also be a cause, triggering the problem in the first place?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the last decade, Alice Lang, 24, has struggled with severe&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/skin-conditions/acne-leaflet\">acne</a>. The condition, which as a teenager didn't really set her apart, took centre stage in her life when it persisted into adulthood, causing her a great deal of distress. The frequent breakouts of spots and the stigma attached to acne had a negative impact on her self-worth, often making her feel anxious and powerless as the years went by.</p>\r\n<p>\"Acne has been one of the biggest causes of stress in my life. That may sound shallow to some, but because of the constant influx of pretty, perfect faces on social media and in advertising, I just felt like I wasn't good enough. It made my self-esteem drop to rock bottom, so I wasn't confident in anything I was doing,\" explains Lang, who now seeks to empower others with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://notesbyalice.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a blog on her acne journey.</a></p>\r\n<p>She is not alone. Many people who have severe acne like her, but also people with other skin diseases such as psoriasis, report that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352647517300990\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">low self-esteem and anxiety are part of their daily lives.</a></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">A complex link</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A strong link exists between mental well-being and skin health, going way back to childhood, from the first skin-to-skin contact between mothers and their babies. Healthcare professionals have now established that acne and other skin problems can cause stress and poor mental health. However, this is a complex relationship, and untangling cause and effect is no easy feat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"The link between stress and dermatological conditions is difficult to study in humans. It has been suggested that some skin problems are exacerbated by stress. However, the other way around has also been well established. If patients have serious skin conditions, they will become more stressed,\" Dr Anton Alexandroff, consultant dermatologist and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.britishskinfoundation.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">British Skin Foundation</a>&nbsp;spokesperson, explains.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In a recent Patient survey, 90% of healthcare professionals agreed that stress could&nbsp;exacerbate&nbsp; skin problems. 92% said that skin problems could also make mental health problems such as stress, anxiety and depression worse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This is something that Lang is familiar with. Her acne is severe and persistent, and it wasn't initially caused by stress. Yet, over the years, she has noticed a correlation between her emotional state and the severity of her skin problems.</p>\r\n<p>\"I think the stress of feeling so bad about myself and so worried all the time, increased the severity of my acne. My skin would occasionally clear up, but then I'd get a small spot and worry myself all day that my spots were coming back - and I'd have five new ones the following morning,&rdquo; she says.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What does the research show?</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Research up to now has mostly focused on stress as a result of dermatological problems, rather than as a cause. In particular, scientists have investigated some of the most common dermatological conditions such as acne, eczema, alopecia, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/skin-conditions/psoriasis-leaflet\">psoriasis</a>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"It's important to note, however, that this group of patients has been more ready than other groups to come forward in terms of communicating. There are 'gaps' in research of other skin conditions which may reveal similar emotional and stressful experiences,\" says Simon Oates, CEO of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindandskin.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Mind &amp; Skin</a>, a charity working to improve patients' quality of life.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But studies investigating the role of stress in triggering skin problems have also emerged over the years. As early as the late 1970s, it was shown that patients with acne reported a worsening of the condition after going through a stressful event. Over the following decades, small questionnaire-based studies have confirmed this, showing that acne can be aggravated during stressful times,<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12873885\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">&nbsp;such as exam periods.</a>&nbsp;The same has been suggested with other conditions such as eczema or, to a lesser degree,<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjd.16116\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">&nbsp;psoriasis.</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The problem is that many of these studies still suffer from limitations, including small sample sizes, and the difficulty of conducting experiments in the lab to evaluate the impact of stress in real life.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The biological mechanisms linking stress and skin conditions also have yet to be clearly explained. But scientists have already established that chronic stress can interfere<a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Recognizing_the_mind-skin_connection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">&nbsp;with the immune system and with the permeability of the skin</a>, making it less efficient at keeping harmful substances out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, there is evidence that stress is associated with the production of certain hormones, or with the secretion of substances that promote inflammation in the body.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline are produced by people when they experience high levels of anxiety. Those can affect the skin and lead to problems,\" says Alexandroff.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How to deal with the stress of skin problems</h2>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Don't be afraid to seek medical help</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Skin problems often go hand in a hand with shame and stigma, especially because these are conditions that are immediately visible. An open relationship with your doctor is the first step to battle the condition and the stress that goes with it. This includes going to see a doctor for the actual condition, but also a mental health professional if the burden of skin problems becomes too much.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"I would advise all patients to be more open in communicating with their doctor. It is also important to understand that there is not always a 'cure' and that recovery of dermatological symptoms can take time to improve. I would also suggest patients enquire about mental health services. Unfortunately, they may have to be patient due to a lack of services and to high demand,\" Oates points out.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Open up to those close to you</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Being transparent to friends and family about how your skin problems are making you feel can be helpful to get some perspective.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Just talking through feelings and discussing acne really helped me - sometimes, you just need someone else to help you see things a little more rationally and remind you that you're much more than your skin,\" says Lang.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Turn to peer support and charities</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are many resources and support groups available online to discuss skin problems and stress. Online communities such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/forums\">Patient.info forums</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.psoriasis.org/talk-psoriasis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Talk Psoriasis Support Community</a>&nbsp;are good examples of platforms which can inspire patients to share their stories, and to boost each other's well-being by connecting, exchanging information, and meeting new friends.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Turning to charities such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.changingfaces.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Changing Faces</a>, which are doing a lot to raise awareness and to fight stigma, and joining their campaigns, can also be a good option. Interesting resources can also be found on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bad.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">British Association of Dermatologists&rsquo; website&nbsp;</a>and on Mind &amp; Skin, with a lot of up-to-date information, from podcasts to articles, to guide patients, including with stress management.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But it's acne awareness which has really increased a lot in recent years, with social media acting as a powerful platform to spread the message. On Instagram and YouTube, there are interesting channels dedicated to talking about acne and the stress it creates. More and more people are posting raw photos of pimples, redness and scars, to show the reality of living with acne, as well as video diaries, testimonials and treatment advice.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Be yourself</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most significant improvements will come from patients realising their worth as individuals, with or without skin problems.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"One of my best tips is to stop obsessing over your face. Looking in the mirror every hour will only tempt you to pick at your skin and obsess over the slightest change, leading to stress. Try not to worry about what people think. What I've come to realise as I've got a little older is that good people who genuinely care about you won't care about your skin problems,\" Lang says.</p>",

However, in reality, they can occur at any age. In fact, about 8 in every 100 heart attacks occur in those under 55, and 1 in 4 heart attacks in women affects an under-60. They are also twice as likely to be fatal in young women compared to young men, often because they are missed until too late.</p>\r\n<h2>A shock to the system</h2>\r\n<p>Hannah Wrigley was just 26 years old when she had a heart attack.</p>\r\n<p>\"My heart attack was completely unexpected. I was cleaning one Tuesday morning, and I started coughing rather dramatically. I suddenly collapsed to the ground with the worst imaginable burning in the centre of my chest and a crushing pain.\" A few hours later Hannah experienced a heavy left arm and a persistent feeling of pressure in her chest as well as feeling intensely nauseated.</p>\r\n<p>When an ambulance arrived, the ECG read 'acute MI (heart attack) in progress'. Despite this, it was not until Hannah underwent an angiogram a number of hours later that doctors agreed about her diagnosis, simply due to her age and lack of risk factors. Delays in treatment, especially in young women whose MIs are not recognised, can significantly affect outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>Hannah has since been found to have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/allergies-blood-immune/blood-clotting-tests/antiphospholipid-syndrome\">antiphospholipid syndrome</a>, a tendency for her blood to clot more than usual. Before the heart attack Hannah was a strict vegan and not overweight but says she was an anxious, highly strung person. The heart attack has made her revaluate and reassess her priorities.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h3>Taking appropriate action</h3>\r\n<p>The heart attack resulted in her making physical changes, including starting to eat oily fish and doing gentle yoga and Pilates. In addition, she reassessed her health behaviours and reduced a stressful lifestyle. \"I had a huge mental shift and reassessed my priorities, reducing levels of stress.\"</p>\r\n<p>She is also on medication to reduce the risk of her blood clotting again in the future and knows the signs and symptoms to look for. These signs include central crushing chest pain, or a heaviness or discomfort that may spread into the left arm, breathlessness, and nausea or grey tinge to your complexion. Importantly, women are less likely to get the 'classic' central crushing chest pain we see people collapsing with in TV soaps. Instead,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/blogs/sarah-says/2016/05/heart-attacks-in-women-the-classic-female-symptom-isn-t-severe-chest-pain\">symptoms in women are often more vague</a>&nbsp;- another possible reason for higher death rates among women. Knowing the signs can save lives.</p>\r\n<h2>Cardiac health in those who are active</h2>\r\n<p>Keeping active is thought to help keep your heart healthy. It is thought that being physically active can decrease your chance of heart disease or stroke by up to 50%, a fantastic incentive for people to get active. Regular exercise can help lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, help control weight and improve your general health and well-being as well.</p>\r\n<p>People who are very physically active (more than five hours of intense exercise a week) may develop an athlete&rsquo;s heart (athletic heart syndrome). This is a normal physiological change in their heart that takes place over time in response to exercise.</p>\r\n<p>The heart becomes enlarged and beats more slowly, pumping more blood each time it beats. No treatment is required for people with athletic heart syndrome and it does not pose any physical threats to the athlete. However, if these signs (slow heartbeat and an enlarged heart) occur in a non-athletic person, they need to be thoroughly investigated.</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Sudden cardiac death in athletes</h2>\r\n<p>Sudden cardiac death is a natural unexpected death from a cardiac arrest (the heart stopping), and usually it occurs during exercise. As scary as it is seeing somebody like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/mar/25/muamba-collapse-minute-by-minute\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Fabrice Muamba</a>&nbsp;collapse in the middle of a Premier League football match, it is very rare.</p>\r\n<p>Usually it is caused by either an inherited heart condition or cardiovascular disease (a heart attack) even if the person is physically fit.</p>\r\n<p>It is important to remember that sudden cardiac death is extremely rare, but if you are concerned, please speak to your doctor. This is especially important if you have a family history of cardiac problems or unexplained collapses. Often, there are no preceding symptoms but there does appear to be a link in some athletes who experience fainting or near fainting during exercise. If this is the case or you are concerned please see your doctor for advice.</p>\r\n<p>For nearly all individuals, regular exercise is very beneficial to the health of the heart, resulting in better heart health. However, as illustrated by Hannah&rsquo;s story and those of athletes who suffer sudden cardiac death, heart disease can affect the young as well, so it is important to be aware of the signs and symptoms.</p>",

However, be sure to wash your hands after touching them as they could be passed on to other parts of the body or to other people.</p>\r\n<p>Fordyce Spots are sebaceous glands - they make a thick moisturiser-like substance for the skin but without hairs coming out of them as on other parts of the body - and manifest as small yellowish or white spots on the head or shaft of the penis.</p>\r\n<p>They may appear more alarming, but, again, fret not - up to 95% of adult men have them and they don't generally require any treatment.</p>\r\n<p>A lymphocele - a hard lump that appears after sex or masturbating - can seem even more worrying, not least because it's usually self-inflicted.</p>\r\n<p>No worries; this swelling caused by a temporary blockage of lymph channels that drain away clear lymph fluid (important in immunity) usually goes away in no time at all and won't cause any permanent problems.</p>\r\n<h2>A spot of bother</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://patient.info/sexual-health/chlamydia\">Chlamydia</a>, warts and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/sexual-health/sexually-transmitted-infections-leaflet/gonorrhoea\">gonorrhoea&nbsp;</a>are the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and, of these,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/sexual-health/sexually-transmitted-infections-leaflet/anogenital-warts\">genital warts</a>&nbsp;are the most common in the UK. They look like small fleshy lumps, sometimes with a cauliflower-shaped surface, and appear on their own or in crops.</p>\r\n<p>Genital warts usually disappear on their own in time but you can pass them on to others,via sexual contact so, guys, be responsible and use a condom to prevent transmission. They can also be treated with special creams or paints, or even 'burned' off with a laser/liquid nitrogen - nerve-wracking, sure, but relatively painless.</p>\r\n<p>Long-term, doctors hope that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/childrens-health/immunisation/human-papillomavirus-immunisation-hpv\">human papillomavirus</a>&nbsp;(HPV) vaccination being given to girls will be extended to boys, which will not only reduce cervical cancer rates but also genital warts.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes a crop of painful blisters or red spots can appear on the penis or groin, which could be indicative of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/sexual-health/sexually-transmitted-infections-leaflet/genital-herpes\">genital herpes</a>. Be proactive and seek medical advice as early as you can - doctors will most likely prescribe tablets to reduce the length of the flare and advise about how to prevent passing the herpes simplex virus on.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://patient.info/mens-health/penis-problems/peyronies-disease\">Peyronie's disease</a>&nbsp;describes a hard lump (called a plaque) that develops on one side of the penis shaft, causing it to bend when erect and interfering with penetration or achieving an erection.</p>\r\n<p>Peyronie's can be caused by aggressive sex or masturbation and is often more difficult to treat - shockwave therapy or even an operation are two options.</p>\r\n<p>\"Guys often come to me with pearly penile papules, but more commonly I'm getting more and more young men coming to me with Peyronie's,\" says Dr Anand Patel, a specialist in sexual function. \"This may be related to more aggressive sex and/or masturbating since pornography has been around.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>What types of spots and pimples on the penis can be a sign of something more serious?</h2>\r\n<p>\"Ulcers or lumps - other than pearly penile papules - that won't go away should be checked out,\" advises Patel. \"A single painless ulcer, or chancre, can be the first presentation of early&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/sexual-health/syphilis\">syphilis</a>&nbsp;and will require antibiotics. If you've got a lump (usually on the head of the penis) that's not going away or is getting bigger, please do get it checked out, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patient.info/mens-health/penis-problems/penile-cancer\">penile cancer</a>&nbsp;is an uncommon possibility.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-content-target\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>If in doubt, get it checked out</h2>\r\n<p>So guys, if you are worried about spots or pimples on your penis, don't waste time worrying unnecessarily - make an appointment with a GP or sexual health clinic and put your mind at rest.</p>\r\n<p>\"People sometimes avoid getting checked because they're embarrassed, or just hope any problem will go away,\" says O'Sullivan. \"But it's often easier to treat a problem if it's identified early, and if it's something more serious it means you can be referred urgently.</p>\r\n<p>\"And if it isn't anything to worry about, at least then you'll know for sure!\"</p>\r\n<p>Patel concurs: \"If you've read this and you're still not clear, then please go and get checked out either at your GP or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic, where you'll see doctors and nurses who see this sort of problem many times a day!\" he says.</p>\r\n<p>\"The earlier you see us, the sooner we can ease your concerns or get you some treatment.\"</p>",
