<p class="responsive">The world of vitamins and supplements can be overwhelming. Between letter vitamins, herbal supplements, and multivitamins, you may have trouble choosing which products are best for you and understanding how to select the highest quality product.</p>
<p class="responsive">What&rsquo;s more, some people find it challenging to remember to take vitamins and to refill them when they run out.</p>
<p class="responsive">That&rsquo;s where vitamin subscription services come in. These services take the guesswork out of vitamin purchases by offering suggestions based on questionnaires or blood testing.</p>
<p class="responsive">These companies also automatically ship monthly refills so that you never run out. Some even package your daily vitamins in individual envelopes, making it easy to grab the day&rsquo;s vitamins without opening multiple bottles.</p>
<p>Healthline&rsquo;s dietitians looked at 12 of the most popular personalized vitamin services on the market, and only 8 services ultimately passed both our dietitians&rsquo; review and our internal vetting process.</p>
<h2>How we chose these vitamin subscription services</h2>
<p>We determined the best personalized vitamins and vitamin subscription services using the following criteria:</p>
<ul class="responsive">
<li><strong>Quality:</strong>&nbsp;Are the supplements made from high quality ingredients and free of artificial additives such as colors and preservatives? Are the products third-party tested, or do they undergo testing at multiple stages of manufacturing?</li>
<li><strong>Selection:</strong>&nbsp;Does the service offer a wide selection of products to meet the needs of most people?</li>
<li><strong>Individualization:</strong>&nbsp;Does the company provide recommendations based on a health assessment or test and allow you to add or remove products as you see fit?</li>
<li><strong>Helpfulness:</strong>&nbsp;Does the service provide evidence-based information about the supplements it recommends or access to health professionals, such as doctors or registered dietitians (RDs), for paying members?</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with FDA guidelines:</strong>&nbsp;The brands on our list adhere to allowable health claims and labeling requirements, per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. They also manufacture products in facilities that adhere to the current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs) established by the FDA.</li>
<li><strong>Hands-on testing:&nbsp;</strong>Healthline editors and writers tested several services to see whether each one was seamless from signup to delivery. We also paid attention to how easy the supplements were to take and whether there were any side effects.</li>
<li><strong>Vetting:</strong>&nbsp;The brands on our list have been vetted to ensure that they align with Healthline&rsquo;s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being.

<h2>How to choose the best vitamin subscription service</h2>
<p class="responsive">When choosing a vitamin subscription service, there are several factors to consider, such as the type of personalization offered, access to health professionals, cost, and brand reputation.</p>
<h3 class=" responsive">What type of personalization are you looking for?</h3>
<p class="responsive">If you&rsquo;d rather pick and choose the supplements you want, a service such as Ritual may work best.</p>
<p class="responsive">However, if you want recommendations based on your health needs, choose a service that offers either an online health assessment or blood testing.</p>
<h3 class=" responsive">Do you want access to health professionals?</h3>
<p class="responsive">Several companies, including HUM Nutrition, also offer access to health professionals such as&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/dietitian-vs-nutritionist">dietitians</a>&nbsp;for questions and supplement guidance.</p>
<h3 class=" responsive">What&rsquo;s your budget?</h3>
<p class="responsive">Vitamin subscription services can cost $25&ndash;$100 or more per month. If you&rsquo;re looking for affordability, Nurish by Nature Made is a good option.</p>
<h3 class=" responsive">Is the brand known for making high quality products?</h3>
<p class="responsive">Finally, make sure that the vitamin subscription service you choose is reputable and transparent, meaning that the company&rsquo;s products are manufactured in facilities that adhere to the CGMPs.</p>
<p class="responsive">Because the FDA doesn&rsquo;t regulate dietary supplements the same way that it does pharmaceuticals, it&rsquo;s also a good idea to choose supplements that are third-party tested to verify that the contents of the bottle match what is listed on the label.</p>
<div>
<h2>Are personalized vitamin services worth it?</h2>
</div>
<p class="responsive">Whether a personalized vitamin service is worth it depends on the service and whether you value the convenience it offers.</p>
<p class="responsive">In particular, these services can be beneficial for people who are unsure of which supplements they should be taking and people who regularly forget to reorder their supplements.</p>
<p class="responsive">Some services offer additional features, such as access to a dietitian, that may make them worth a slightly higher cost.</p>
<p class="responsive">Still, keep in mind that these services are typically more expensive than buying supplements from a local or online pharmacy.</p>
<p class="responsive">Additionally, the health quizzes that many personalized vitamin companies use are not a substitute for a thorough medical review by a healthcare professional. And the quizzes may recommend more supplements than you need.</p>
<p class="responsive">It&rsquo;s best to share your supplement recommendations with a trusted healthcare professional, such as a doctor or dietitian, before clicking the subscribe button.</p>
<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3 class=" responsive">Do you need to take vitamins?</h3>
<p class="responsive">Most people can meet their nutritional needs by following a&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-eat-healthy-guide">healthy diet</a>.</p>
<p class="responsive">However, vitamins can be beneficial in some cases, especially for people with certain health conditions or restrictive diets.</p>
<p class="responsive">Your doctor or dietitian can help determine whether you may benefit from adding vitamins or other supplements to your routine.</p>
<h3 class=" responsive">How much do Persona vitamins cost?</h3>
<p class="responsive">Your monthly subscription price for Persona Nutrition can vary and may depend on several factors, including the specific supplements you add to your daily vitamin pack. However, each individual supplement can range from around $2&ndash;$39 for a 28-day supply.</p>
<h3 class=" responsive">Are personalized vitamins safe?</h3>
<p class="responsive">Personalized supplements provide the same vitamins and minerals as regular supplements and are generally safe for most healthy adults when used as directed.</p>
<p class="responsive">However, if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications, it&rsquo;s best to check in with a doctor before adding new supplements to your routine.</p>
<p>And, whenever possible, it&rsquo;s best to opt for products that have been through third-party testing, which can help ensure safety and quality.</p>
<h3 class=" responsive">Are personalized supplements worth it?</h3>
<p>Personalized vitamin subscriptions may be worth the price if you enjoy having a customized supplement routine catered to your unique needs. Additionally, many services offer simple daily packs, which can be a convenient and space-saving alternative to dealing with multiple vitamin bottles each day.</p>
<h3>Can I design my own vitamins?</h3>
<p>Many vitamin brands provide customized supplement recommendations based on factors such as your age, gender, and health goals.</p>
<p>Vous Vitamin also offers personalized vitamins, which are formulated with a unique blend of nutrients tailored to your needs.</p>
