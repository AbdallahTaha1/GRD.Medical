<p>Following a healthy lifestyle often seems incredibly complicated.</p>
<p>Advertisements and experts all around you seem to give conflicting advice.</p>
<p>However, leading a healthy life doesn&rsquo;t need to be complicated.</p>
<p>To gain optimal health, lose weight and feel better every day, all you need to do is follow these 5 simple rules.</p>
<h2>2. Lift Things and Move Around</h2>
<p>Using your muscles is extremely important for optimal health.</p>
<p>While lifting weights and exercising can certainly help you look better, improving your appearance is really just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>You also need to exercise to ensure your body, brain and hormones function optimally.</p>
<p>Lifting weights lowers your blood sugar and insulin levels, improves cholesterol and lowers triglycerides (<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003999305002121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a>).</p>
<p>It also raises your levels of testosterone and growth hormones, both associated with improved well-being (<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15831061" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, exercise can help reduce depression and your risk of various chronic diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer&rsquo;s and many more (<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2006.00520.x/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>
<p>Additionally, exercise may help you lose fat, especially in combination with a healthy diet. It doesn&rsquo;t just burn calories, but also improves your hormone levels and overall body function.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are many ways to&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-start-exercising">exercise</a>. You don&rsquo;t need to go to a gym or own expensive workout equipment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to exercise for free and in the comfort of your own home. Just do a search on Google or YouTube for &ldquo;bodyweight workouts&rdquo; or &ldquo;calisthenics,&rdquo; for example.</p>
<p>Going outside to hike or take a walk is another important thing you should do, especially if you can get some sun while you&rsquo;re at it (for a natural source of vitamin D). Walking is a good choice and a highly underrated form of exercise.</p>
<p>The key is to choose something that you enjoy and can stick with in the long run.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re completely out of shape or have medical problems, it&rsquo;s a good idea to talk to your doctor or a qualified health professional before starting a new training program.</p>
<h2>3. Sleep Like a Baby</h2>
<p>Sleep is very important for overall health and studies show that sleep deprivation correlates with many diseases, including obesity and heart disease (<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24892893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>,&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033062008000911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7</a>,&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4791534/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s highly recommended to make time for good, quality sleep.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t seem to sleep properly, there are several ways you can try to improve it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t drink coffee late in the day.</li>
<li>Try to go to bed and wake up at similar times each day.</li>
<li>Sleep in complete darkness, with no artificial lighting.</li>
<li>Dim the lights in your home a few hours before bedtime.</li>

</ul>
<p>It may also be a good idea to see your doctor. Sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, are very common and in many cases easily treatable.</p>
<h2>4. Avoid Excess Stress</h2>
<p>But the way you feel and how you think is also very important. Being stressed all the time is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>Excess stress can raise&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ways-to-lower-cortisol">cortisol levels</a>&nbsp;and severely impair your metabolism. It can increase junk food cravings, fat in your stomach area and raise your risk of various diseases (<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29309851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>,&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1467-789x.2001.00027.x/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>,&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9626108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>
<p>Studies also show that stress is a significant contributor to depression, which is a massive health problem today (<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453005000831" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12</a>,&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24417575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>
<p>To&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/16-ways-relieve-stress-anxiety">reduce stress</a>, try to simplify your life &mdash; exercise, take nature walks, practice deep-breathing techniques and maybe even meditation.</p>
<p>If you absolutely cannot handle the burdens of your daily life without becoming overly stressed, consider seeing a psychologist.</p>
<p>Not only will overcoming your stress make you healthier, it will also improve your life in other ways. Going through life worried, anxious and never being able to relax and enjoy yourself is a big waste.</p>

<p>A healthy lifestyle involves a wholesome diet, quality sleep and regular exercise.</p>
<h2>5. Nourish Your Body With Real Foods</h2>
<p>The simplest and most effective way to eat healthy is to focus on&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/50-super-healthy-foods">real foods</a>.</p>
<p>Choose unprocessed, whole foods that resemble what they looked like in nature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s best to eat a combination of animals and plants &mdash; meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, as well as healthy fats, oils and high-fat dairy products.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re healthy, lean and active, eating whole, unrefined carbs is absolutely fine. These include potatoes, sweet potatoes, legumes and whole grains such as oats.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re overweight, obese or have shown signs of metabolic issues such as diabetes or metabolic syndrome, then&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/low-carb-diet-meal-plan-and-menu">cutting back on major carbohydrate sources</a>&nbsp;can lead to dramatic improvements (<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2012.01021.x/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">14<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>,&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17684196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>,&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2008.00518.x/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">16<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>
<p>People can often lose a lot of weight simply by cutting back on carbohydrates because they subconsciously start eating less (<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17228046" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">17<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>,&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12679447" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>).</p>
<p>Whatever you do, make an effort to choose whole, unprocessed foods instead of foods that look like they were made in a factory.</p>
