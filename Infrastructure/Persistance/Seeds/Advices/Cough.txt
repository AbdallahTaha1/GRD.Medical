<h1>14 Best Natural Cough Remedies and Prevention Tips</h1>
<p>A cough is one of the most common reasons people may seek medical treatment. An estimated&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493221/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493221/">40%<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;of all cases may require a referral to a pulmonologist, a doctor specializing in lung conditions.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, coughing is perfectly natural. A&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cough">cough</a>&nbsp;can help clear your throat of&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/how-to-get-rid-of-phlegm">phlegm</a>, dust, and other irritants. However, sustained coughing can also be a symptom of many health conditions.</p>
<p>These may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/allergies">allergies</a></li>
<li>a viral infection</li>
<li>a bacterial infection</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes a cough isn&rsquo;t caused by anything related to your lungs.&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/gerd">Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)</a>&nbsp;can also cause a cough.</p>
<p>You can treat coughs due to&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/common-cold-symptoms">colds</a>, allergies, and&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/sinus-infection-symptoms">sinus infections</a>&nbsp;with several over-the-counter (OTC) medications. Bacterial infections often require antibiotics.</p>
<p>Along with medication treatment, you can ask a doctor about other options to help your cough.</p>
<p>Here we&rsquo;ve listed a few home remedies to consider.</p>
<h2>1. Honey</h2>
<p><a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/top-raw-honey-benefits">Honey</a>&nbsp;is a time-honored remedy for a sore throat.</p>
<p>According to a&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6513626/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2018 review<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;on the effects of honey on acute cough in children, researchers found that honey may relieve coughs more effectively than some OTC medications. These medications included those containing diphenhydramine (Benadryl), a type of&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sleep/antihistamine-for-sleep" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sleep/antihistamine-for-sleep">antihistamine</a>, and salbutamol (ProAir), a prescription&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/asthma-medication-and-drugs" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.healthline.com/health/asthma-medication-and-drugs">bronchodilator</a>.</p>
<p>However, the same review didn&rsquo;t find honey significantly more effective than dextromethorphan (Delsym), an&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/common-cold-drugs" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.healthline.com/health/common-cold-drugs">OTC cough suppressant</a>.</p>
<p>You can create your own remedy at home by mixing up to 2 teaspoons of honey with herbal tea or warm water and lemon.</p>
<p>The honey does the soothing, while the lemon juice can help with congestion. You can also eat the 2 teaspoons of honey or spread it on bread as a snack.</p>
<p>Due to the risk of botulism, never feed honey to infants under&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/prevention.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/prevention.html">12 months old<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>.</p>
<h2>2. Probiotics</h2>
<p><a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/probiotics-and-digestive-health/suprising-benefits-probiotics">Probiotics</a>&nbsp;are microorganisms that can provide a host of health benefits. While they don&rsquo;t relieve a cough directly, they&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/probiotics-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/probiotics-what-you-need-to-know">do help balance<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;your gastrointestinal flora. Gastrointestinal flora are bacteria that live in your intestines.</p>
<p>This balance can support immune system function throughout the body. A&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25927096/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2015 study<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;suggested a decrease in the number of people having upper respiratory infections after being given various strains of probiotics, though the evidence is still inconclusive.</p>
<p>Each supplement manufacturer may have different daily recommended intakes. Probiotics are also added to&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/bifidus" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/bifidus">some yogurt types</a>&nbsp;and are present in miso soup and kombucha.</p>
<p>Given the variations of probiotics available, you should talk with a doctor about which probiotic is right for you and your condition. The most natural way to get probiotics is through&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/8-fermented-foods" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/8-fermented-foods">fermented foods</a>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>miso</li>
<li>sauerkraut</li>
<li>yogurt</li>
<li>kefir</li>
<li>kombucha</li>
<li>tempeh</li>
<li>kimchi</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Bromelain</h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t usually think of&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pineapple-juice-for-cough">pineapple</a>&nbsp;as a cough remedy, but that might be because you&rsquo;ve never heard of bromelain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8573830/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slight evidence<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;to suggest that&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/bromelain" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.healthline.com/health/bromelain">bromelain</a>&nbsp;&mdash; an enzyme found only in the stem and fruit of pineapples &mdash; may help suppress coughs.</p>
<p>To enjoy the most benefits of pineapple and bromelain, eat a slice of pineapple or drink 3.5 ounces of fresh pineapple juice three times a day.</p>
<p>Some&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6036946/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;from 2018 suggests it may help relieve&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/sinusitis">sinusitis</a>&nbsp;and allergy-based sinus issues, which can contribute to coughs and mucus. However, there&rsquo;s insufficient&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://nccih.nih.gov/health/bromelain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evidence<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;to support this, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also sometimes used to treat inflammation and swelling.</p>
<p>Children or adults who take&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/high-cholesterol/blood-thinners" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.healthline.com/health/high-cholesterol/blood-thinners">blood thinners</a>&nbsp;shouldn&rsquo;t take bromelain supplements. Also, if you&rsquo;re taking&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/how-do-antibiotics-work" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.healthline.com/health/how-do-antibiotics-work">antibiotics</a>, such as amoxicillin, avoid using bromelain, as it can increase the absorption of the antibiotic.</p>
<p>Always speak with a doctor before taking new supplements, especially if you&rsquo;re taking other medications or supplements. Some may cause interactions.</p>
<h2>4. Peppermint</h2>
<p><a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/peppermint-health-potential">Peppermint</a>&nbsp;leaves are well known for their healing properties. Not only is it common to find peppermint in an assortment of foods and beverages, but peppermint oil&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/peppermint-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/peppermint-oil">may also<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;help relieve cold symptoms. The menthol may be soothing for a cough, too.</p>
<p>You can benefit by drinking&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/peppermint-tea-pregnancy" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/peppermint-tea-pregnancy">peppermint tea</a>&nbsp;or inhaling peppermint vapors from a steam treatment.</p>
<p>To make a steam treatment, add 7 or 8 drops of&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-peppermint-oil">peppermint essential oil</a>&nbsp;to about a cup of just boiled water. Drape a towel over your head and take deep breaths directly above the water.</p>
<h2>5. Marshmallow root</h2>
<p><a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/marshmallow-root" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/marshmallow-root">Marshmallow root</a>&nbsp;comes from&nbsp;<em>Althaea officinalis</em>, a perennial that flowers in summer. It&rsquo;s not the same as the&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/marshmallow-sore-throat" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/marshmallow-sore-throat">squishy marshmallow</a>&nbsp;that you roast over a fire.</p>
<p>The leaves and roots of the marshmallow plant have been used since ancient times to treat sore throats and suppress coughs.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00290/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 study</a>&nbsp;found that the marshmallow plant was effective at reducing a cough due to its soothing effect on the irritated tissues of the throat and sinuses. This could be due to the plant&rsquo;s anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties.</p>
<p>The marshmallow root also contains mucilage, which coats the throat and soothes irritation.</p>
<p>Today, you can get marshmallow root in&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/tea-for-cough" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.healthline.com/health/tea-for-cough">tea</a>&nbsp;or in capsule form. The warm tea can be soothing for a cough that occurs with a&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/sore-throat-and-headache" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.healthline.com/health/sore-throat-and-headache">sore throat</a>.</p>
<p>Although the herb is generally considered safe, doctors don&rsquo;t recommend marshmallow root and leaves for children.</p>
<h2>6. Thyme</h2>
<p>Some people use&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/health-benefits-of-thyme">thyme</a>&nbsp;for respiratory illnesses. In fact, one&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34340607/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="URL" data-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34340607/">2021 randomized controlled trial<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;found that thyme and ivy herbal extract helped reduce both acute cough and cough severity in study participants. The participants also didn&rsquo;t report any adverse side effects.</p>
<p>Thyme leaves may contain compounds called flavonoids that relax the throat muscles involved in coughing and lessen inflammation.</p>
<p>You can make thyme tea at home using 2 teaspoons of crushed thyme leaves and 1 cup of boiling water. Cover the cup, steep for 10 minutes, and strain.</p>
<h2>7. Saltwater gargle</h2>
<p>While the remedy may seem relatively simple, a&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/salt-water-gargle" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.healthline.com/health/salt-water-gargle">salt and water gargle</a>&nbsp;may help soothe a scratchy throat and break up mucus that causes you to cough.</p>

<p>Note that since children&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ada.org/resources/research/science-and-research-institute/oral-health-topics/mouthrinse-mouthwash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ada.org/resources/research/science-and-research-institute/oral-health-topics/mouthrinse-mouthwash">under 6 years old</a>&nbsp;aren&rsquo;t especially good at gargling, it&rsquo;s best to try other remedies for this age group.</p>

<h2>9. Slippery elm</h2>
<p><a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/slippery-elm-bark">Slippery elm</a>&nbsp;is an ancient remedy for coughing and sore throat. People claim it may reduce inflammation and soothe the lining of your throat.</p>

However, slippery elm isn&rsquo;t associated with any serious side effects.</p>
<p>Slippery elm is available as capsules, tablets, lozenges, and tea. Lozenges and tea may be ideal for easing throat irritation.</p>
<h2>10. Turmeric</h2>
<p><a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/top-10-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-turmeric">Turmeric</a>&nbsp;has been used traditionally for many ailments over the years, including coughing. Its active compound, curcumin,&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jsfa.11372" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="URL" data-id="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jsfa.11372">has potent<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
