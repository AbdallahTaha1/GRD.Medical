<h1>How to Lower Your Risk of Prostate Cancer</h1>
<p>Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in people with a prostate. According to the&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Cancer Society (ACS)<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>, it&rsquo;s also the second leading cause of death, behind lung cancer, among men in the United States.</p>
<p>Prostate cancer can affect anyone with a prostate. People with a prostate may identify as any&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/sex-vs-gender">gender</a>&nbsp;and can include men, women, and non-binary people.</p>
<p>While there&rsquo;s no absolute way to prevent prostate cancer, there are some things you can do that may lower your risk. Maintaining a moderate body weight, getting regular exercise, and paying attention to what you eat and drink all play key roles.</p>
<p>In this article, we&rsquo;ll take a closer look at what you can do to lower your risk of prostate cancer. Keep reading to discover more.</p>
<h2>Eat red fruits and vegetables</h2>
<p>Tomatoes, watermelon, and other red foods contain a powerful antioxidant called&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lycopene">lycopene</a>. A&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332220306521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 review</a>&nbsp;of studies on this topic notes that current research supports that lycopene can effectively reduce the progression and growth of prostate cancer cells.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32100191/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 study<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;found that eating canned and cooked&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/tomatoes">tomatoes</a>&nbsp;more than 4 times per week was associated with a 28 percent decrease in prostate cancer risk compared with never eating these foods. However, the researchers noted that, while there was some evidence linking tomatoes to lower risk of prostate cancer, more studies need to be done.</p>
<p>This point is emphasized by a&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.625185/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 meta-analysis</a>&nbsp;of 10 studies on tomatoes and prostate cancer. After the analysis was complete, researchers found no significant association between eating tomatoes and prostate cancer risk. They also noted that additional, larger studies are necessary.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/types-of-tomatoes">add more tomatoes</a>&nbsp;to your diet, you may be wondering the best way to consume them. A&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464617307752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2018 study</a>&nbsp;conducted in a laboratory suggests that cooking tomatoes, specifically frying them, may make it easier for your body to absorb lycopene.</p>
<p>Additionally, the redder the tomato, the better because lycopene accumulates during ripening. That means that pale, store-bought tomatoes that are picked too early have less lycopene than vine-ripened tomatoes.</p>
<h2>Add citrus to your diet</h2>
<p>Eating&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthy-fruit">fresh fruit</a>&nbsp;is an important part of a balanced diet. It&rsquo;s also possible that it may lower your risk of prostate cancer.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5488166/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2017 study<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;found that people who consumed the highest amount of fruit, especially&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/citrus-fruit-benefits">citrus</a>, had a small reduction in their risk of prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Some examples of citrus fruits to consider trying out are:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that grapefruit can interact with&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/grapefruit-and-medications">some types of medication</a>. If you take prescription medications and are unsure whether you can have grapefruit, be sure to talk with your doctor first.</p>
<h2>Consider soybeans and tea</h2>
<p>A nutrient called isoflavones has been linked to a reduced risk of prostate cancer in at least one small&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24053483/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2014 review of controlled studies<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>. Isoflavones are found in:</p>

</ul>
<p>Researchers have also long studied the link between&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/top-10-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-green-tea">green tea</a>&nbsp;and prostate cancer risk, with mixed results. A&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/pcan201718" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">2017 study<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;found that prostate cancer risk was lower in men who drank higher levels of green tea. However, the researchers note that these findings need to be tested in larger studies.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5380255/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2017 meta-analysis<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;examined the findings of 10 studies. It found that the occurrence of prostate cancer decreased with each additional cup of green tea&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-green-tea-per-day">per day</a>. Having more than 7 cups per day was linearly associated with a reduction in prostate cancer risk.</p>
<p>An older&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2789276/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2010 review<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;of investigations into green tea and prostate cancer also notes that cell, animal, and some clinical trials suggest a link between the key ingredients of green tea and a lower risk of prostate cancer. Overall, it finds that further large-scale studies are needed.</p>
<h2>Pour another cup of coffee</h2>
<p>Many of us enjoy a nice&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/top-13-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-coffee">cup of joe</a>&nbsp;in the morning. But did you know that indulging a serious coffee habit is linked to a decreased risk of prostate cancer?</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24584929/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2014 meta-analysis<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;of clinical studies suggests that drinking 4 to 5 cups of coffee every day can lower your overall likelihood of prostate cancer, in addition to lowering chances of fatal and high grade prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a second 2014 meta-analysis saw that the risk of fatal prostate cancer dropped&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4433502/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about 11 percent<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;with every 3 cups of coffee.</p>
<p>These findings are supported by a more recent&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/2/e038902" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 review of studies</a>. After going over 16 cohort studies, researchers found that higher coffee consumption was associated with lower prostate cancer risk. There was a significant linear trend with each additional cup of coffee per day.</p>
<p>This describes a dose-response relationship between prostate cancer and coffee. That means the effect on prostate cancer goes up or down with the amount of coffee you drink. However, these effects may not extend to someone who only grabs an occasional cup.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that high doses of&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-coffee-should-you-drink">caffeine</a>&nbsp;can cause side effects, such as upset stomach, rapid heart rate, and trouble sleeping. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends not exceeding&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">400 milligrams (mg)<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;of caffeine a day, the equivalent of 4 to 5 cups of brewed coffee.</p>
<p>How coffee is prepared may also be a factor. A&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4453658/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2015 study in Norway<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;looked at coffee brewed with a filter and boiled coffee, which doesn&rsquo;t use a filter. Men who drank boiled coffee seemed to have a lower risk of prostate cancer than men who drank coffee prepared another way or not at all.</p>
<p>The chemicals cafestol and kahweol have cancer-fighting abilities. The researchers believe these chemicals are trapped when coffee runs through a paper filter. Boiled coffee may allow these cancer-fighting chemicals to stay in your daily brew.</p>
<h2>Limit fat intake</h2>
<p>A&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4277017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2014 review of research<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;notes there may be a link between&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/saturated-fat">saturated fats</a>&nbsp;and animal fats and an increased prostate cancer risk.</p>
<p>In addition to meat, animal fats are found in lard, butter, and cheese. Some other sources of saturated fat not already mentioned include cakes or pastries, candies, and many types of prepackaged or fast foods.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, replace saturated and animal-based fats with plant-based fats. Try substituting:</p>
<ul>
<li>olive oil instead of butter</li>
<li>fruit instead of candy</li>
<li>fresh vegetables instead of prepackaged foods</li>
<li>nuts or seeds instead of cheese</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, overcooking meat produces carcinogens, so be careful not to overcook your meat.</p>
<h2>If you smoke, try to stop</h2>
<p>According to the&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/risk-factors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACS<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>, most studies haven&rsquo;t found an association between&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/smoking/effects-on-body">smoking</a>&nbsp;and prostate cancer. Overall, more research is needed to better define how smoking may affect prostate cancer risk.</p>
<p>An older&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/646754" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2011 study<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;found that those who smoke at the time of their prostate cancer diagnosis are more likely to have the cancer come back. Additionally, smoking at diagnosis is associated with a higher risk of death due to prostate cancer or other causes, according to a&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41391-019-0178-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">2019 study<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not too late&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/quit-smoking">to quit</a>. When compared with current smokers, both of the studies above noted that people who had&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/quit-smoking/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quit smoking<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;before their diagnosis had a much lower risk of death.</p>
<h2>Keep in mind controversial foods</h2>
<p>For some types of foods and supplements, the data relating to prostate cancer risk is very mixed. Based on this information, it&rsquo;s best to check with your doctor to discuss what is the best choice for you when it comes to these items.</p>
<h3>Fish and omega-3</h3>
<p>Some types of fatty acid, known as omega-3, may help reduce your risk of developing cancer.&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/omega-3-guide">Omega-3</a>&nbsp;is found in dietary supplements as well as certain fish, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/are-sardines-good-for-you">sardines</a></li>
<li>tuna</li>
<li>mackerel</li>
<li>trout</li>
<li>salmon</li>
</ul>
<p>There was a&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/105/15/1132/926341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study in 2013<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;that suggested that men with high concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids in their blood are more likely to develop prostate cancer. However, a&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4677810/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2015 review<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;found some problems with the research and stated that the study actually didn&rsquo;t establish a link between increased intake of omega-3 and increased risk of prostate cancer.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5736071/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2017 systematic review<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;went on to find that there wasn&rsquo;t currently enough evidence to support that omega-3 intake was associated with prostate cancer risk. It concluded that additional research into this topic is needed.</p>
<p>Further, in 2019, researchers at the Intermountain Healthcare Heart Institute presented two new studies about omega-3s at the&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.iscpcardio.org/event/aha-scientific-sessions-2019/#:~:text=November%2016%2C%202019%20%2D%20November%2018%2C%202019&amp;text=The%20AHA%20Scientific%20Sessions%20in,%2C%20population%2C%20or%20basic%20science." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions</a>. Their&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/news/2019/11/omega-3-continues-to-show-protection-against-heart-disease-related-death-without-prostate-cancer-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a>&nbsp;found that omega-3 intake was&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/omega-3s-may-help-your-health">associated</a>&nbsp;with protection from heart disease-related death and also didn&rsquo;t appear to be linked with prostate cancer risk.</p>
<h3>Folate</h3>
<p>Folate is found in many foods, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>green vegetables</li>
<li>beans</li>
<li>whole grains</li>
<li>fortified breakfast cereals</li>
</ul>
<p>It can also be taken as a dietary supplement called&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/folic-acid">folic acid</a>.</p>
<p>Older&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC2657096/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research from 2009<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;followed people taking&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/folic-acid-for-men">folic acid supplements</a>&nbsp;to help prevent&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/colon-cancer">colorectal cancer</a>. Over a 10-year follow-up period, it was found that folic acid supplementation may increase the risk of prostate cancer. However, dietary folate intake actually had a protective effect.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3278486/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2012 systematic review and meta-analysis<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;evaluated studies of folic acid supplementation and cancer risk. It found that prostate cancer was the only cancer type on which folic acid supplementation appeared to boost risk.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/pcan201416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">systematic review and meta-analysis<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;from 2014 looked into this topic further. It found that both dietary and total folate intake, which also included folic acid, had no significant association with prostate cancer.</p>
<h3>Dairy</h3>
<p><a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/8-fast-facts-about-calcium">Calcium</a>&nbsp;has a variety of important benefits for your health. Some studies, according to the&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/risk-factors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACS<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>, have linked dairy products, or diets&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/15-calcium-rich-foods">high in calcium</a>, with an increased risk of prostate cancer. However, studies have been mixed, and this risk hasn&rsquo;t been linked to normal dietary intake of calcium.</p>
<h2>Make time for exercise</h2>
<p>Having overweight or&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-being-overweight-increases-risk-of-cancer">obesity</a>&nbsp;is linked to an increased risk of several types of cancer. However, generally speaking, the connection between prostate cancer risk and weight appears to be complex.</p>
<p>One&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-020-07089-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 study<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;found that there was only a very weak association between&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/body-mass-index">body mass index (BMI)</a>&nbsp;and prostate cancer risk. However, when researchers adjusted for&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/waistline">waist circumference</a>, they saw that increasing BMI was associated with higher prostate cancer risk in those with a larger waist circumference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to note that having overweight or&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/obesity">obesity</a>&nbsp;can have a negative effect if you&rsquo;ve already been diagnosed with prostate cancer. For example, there&rsquo;s an&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1040842821003309" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increased risk</a>&nbsp;of prostate cancer progression and recurrence in these individuals.</p>
<p><a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise">Regular exercise</a>&nbsp;can help you manage your weight. Benefits of exercise include increased muscle mass, better metabolism, and improved cardiovascular health. Try activities like:</p>
<ul>
<li>walking</li>
<li>running</li>
<li>bicycling</li>
<li>swimming</li>
</ul>
<p>Exercise doesn&rsquo;t have to be boring. Change up your routine and invite your friends to participate. You&rsquo;re more likely to work out if it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<h2>Talk with a doctor</h2>
<p>Ask your doctor about your risk of developing prostate cancer. Some points to discuss include:</p>
<ul>
<li>what medical screening tests you should have as you age</li>
<li>your personal or family history of cancer</li>
<li>dietary or other health-related recommendations</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor if you&rsquo;re experiencing symptoms that may be warning signs of&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/prostate-cancer">prostate cancer</a>, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>urinary problems, like:

<h2>Frequently asked questions about prostate cancer</h2>
<p>Below, we&rsquo;ll try to answer some of the additional questions that you may have about prostate cancer.</p>
<h3><strong>How common is prostate cancer?</strong></h3>
<p>According to the&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACS<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>, aside from&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/types-of-skin-cancer">skin cancer</a>, prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer in men in the United States. It&rsquo;s estimated that about 1 in 8 men will develop prostate cancer at some point in their life.</p>
<p>The ACS estimates that about&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">268,490 men<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;in the United States will be newly diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2022. Additionally, about 34,500 men in the United States will die from prostate cancer in 2022.</p>
<h3><strong>What are the other risk factors for prostate cancer?</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to some of the factors we&rsquo;ve discussed above, there are several other known&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/prostate-cancer-risk-factors">risk factors</a>&nbsp;for prostate cancer. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Age.</strong>&nbsp;Your risk of prostate cancer increases as you get older. According to the ACS, around&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/risk-factors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6 in 10 diagnoses<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;of prostate cancer happen in men who are older than 65.</li>
<li><strong>Family history.</strong>&nbsp;If a close biological relative, such as a father or brother, has had prostate cancer, you may be at an increased risk of developing it.</li>
<li><strong>Race.</strong>&nbsp;Although the reasons why are unclear, prostate cancer appears to be&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/risk-factors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more common<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;in African American men. More research is needed to determine why.</li>
<li><strong>Geographic location.</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s unknown exactly why, but prostate cancer is more common in regions of the world like North America, the Caribbean, Europe, and Australia.</li>
<li><strong>Genetic changes.</strong>&nbsp;Some inherited genetic changes, such as those in genes like&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/brca-gene-testing"><em>BRCA1</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>BRCA2</em></a>, may boost your risk of prostate cancer. Additionally, men with an inherited condition called Lynch syndrome are also at a higher risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What&rsquo;s the outlook for prostate cancer?</strong></h3>
<p>When prostate cancer is found early, the outlook is quite good. According to the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, the overall 5-year survival rate of prostate cancer between 2011 and 2017 was&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/prost.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">97.5 percent<span class="css-1471oxf icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a>.</p>
<p>SEER breaks down these statistics further based on the extent of the cancer at diagnosis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Localized.</strong>&nbsp;When cancer remains in the prostate, 5-year survival is nearly 100 percent.</li>
<li><strong>Regional.</strong>&nbsp;If cancer is in the prostate and nearby lymph nodes, the 5-year survival rate is still nearly 100 percent.</li>
<li><strong>Distant.</strong>&nbsp;When the cancer has spread to other organs and tissues, the 5-year survival rate drops to 30.6 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most prostate cancers are diagnosed when they&rsquo;re either localized or regional.</p>
<h3><strong>What types of treatments are used for prostate cancer?</strong></h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re diagnosed with prostate cancer, your doctor will help to develop a&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/prostate-cancer-treatments">treatment plan</a>&nbsp;that&rsquo;s right for your individual situation. It&rsquo;s possible that a combination of different treatment options may be used.</p>
<p>They may recommend something called expectant management if your cancer doesn&rsquo;t cause symptoms. During this time, they may monitor your cancer using a variety of tests. Treatment will begin when you develop symptoms or when test results find the cancer is growing.</p>
<p>Other potential treatment options can include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surgery.</strong>&nbsp;If you only have cancer in your prostate, your doctor may suggest&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/prostate-surgery">surgery</a>&nbsp;to remove the tumor or your prostate.</li>
<li><strong>Radiation therapy.</strong>&nbsp;In&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/radiation-therapy">radiation therapy</a>, high energy radiation is used to kill cancer cells.</li>
<li><strong>Cryotherapy.</strong>&nbsp;During&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cryosurgery">cryotherapy</a>, a special probe is used to freeze and kill cells in your prostate, including cancer cells.</li>
<li><strong>Hormone therapy.</strong>&nbsp;This treatment focuses on blocking hormones that can encourage cancer growth.</li>
<li><strong>Chemotherapy.</strong>&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/prostate-cancer/chemotherapy-for-prostate-cancer">Chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;drugs can kill cancer cells or slow down their growth.</li>

A type of immunotherapy called&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/prostate-cancer/provenge">sipuleucel-T (Provenge)</a>&nbsp;may be used to treat some types of prostate cancer.</li>
<li><strong>Targeted therapy.</strong>&nbsp;Targeted therapy blocks the activity of certain proteins on or in cancer cells. Drugs called&nbsp;<a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/gene-targeting-medication-for-prostate-cancer-does-well-in-clinical-trial">PARP inhibitors</a>&nbsp;may be used to treat some types of prostate cancer.</li>

<h2>Takeaway</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not possible to completely prevent prostate cancer. However, there are some steps you can take to lower your risk.</p>
<p>For example, it&rsquo;s possible that some types of food and drinks may lower prostate cancer risk. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>red fruits or vegetables like tomatoes</li>
<li>soybeans</li>
<li>green tea</li>
<li>coffee</li>
</ul>
<p>Reducing your intake of fats, particularly red meat, may also help reduce your risk.</p>
<p>Aside from diet, other lifestyle factors are also important. Try to take steps to quit smoking, manage your weight, and get regular exercise.</p>
<p>Never hesitate to see your doctor if you develop potential prostate cancer warning signs like urinary problems or pain in your pelvis, hips, or back. If these symptoms aren&rsquo;t caused by prostate cancer, they may be due to another condition that needs to be treated.</p>
