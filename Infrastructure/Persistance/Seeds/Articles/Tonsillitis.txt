<h1 class="articleHeader__title">How to manage tonsillitis in children</h1>
<p>Children pick up viruses all the time, particularly if they&rsquo;re at nursery or playgroups where illnesses can spread easily. It can be hard to know whether a poorly child has a cold or something else such as tonsillitis - an inflammation of the tonsils. So what are the signs of tonsillitis, and how can you treat it in your child?</p>
<h2>What is tonsillitis?</h2>
<p><a href="https://patient.info/ears-nose-throat-mouth/sore-throat-2/tonsillitis">Tonsillitis</a>&nbsp;is an inflammation of the tonsils and it's common in children, although adults and teenagers can get it too. It is normally caused by a virus, which spreads when we&nbsp;<a href="https://patient.info/chest-lungs/cough-leaflet">cough</a>, sneeze, speak or are in physical contact with others. Sometimes, tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection.</p>

<h2>What are the symptoms of tonsillitis in children?</h2>
<p>Tonsillitis can feel like a bad&nbsp;<a href="https://patient.info/news-and-features/difference-between-cold-and-flu">cold</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://patient.info/infections/influenza-and-flu-like-illness">flu</a>, but the tonsils at the back of the throat - the two round lumps - will be red and swollen. The main symptoms in children and adults are a&nbsp;<a href="https://patient.info/ears-nose-throat-mouth/sore-throat-2">sore throat</a>, difficulty swallowing, a high&nbsp;<a href="https://patient.info/childrens-health/fever-in-children-high-temperature">temperature</a>&nbsp;of 38C or higher, a&nbsp;<a href="https://patient.info/chest-lungs/cough-leaflet">cough</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://patient.info/news-and-features/surprising-causes-of-headaches">headaches</a>, feeling sick,&nbsp;<a href="https://patient.info/ears-nose-throat-mouth/earache-ear-pain">earache</a>&nbsp;and feeling tired.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the symptoms can be more severe - such as&nbsp;<a href="https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/oedema-swelling">swollen</a>&nbsp;glands in your neck or blisters on the&nbsp;<a href="https://patient.info/news-and-features/what-do-tonsils-do">tonsils</a>.</p>
<h2>How to treat a child with tonsillitis?</h2>
<p><a href="https://patient.info/news-and-features/tonsillitis-treatment">Tonsillitis</a>&nbsp;usually gets better on its own after a few days, but there are things you can do to help manage the symptoms and keep your child more comfortable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure they get plenty of rest and&nbsp;<a href="https://patient.info/news-and-features/why-do-we-need-sleep">sleep</a>.</li>
<li>Ensure your child drinks plenty of water, which can soothe the throat and prevent dehydration.</li>
<li>Encourage your child to eat soft foods, such as soups, yoghurts or mashed potatoes and cooked vegetables, which can be easier to swallow if they have a sore throat.</li>
<li>You can give your child paracetamol-based medicines, such as Calpol, which can reduce a&nbsp;<a href="https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/fever">fever</a>&nbsp;and ease pain. You can also give them children&rsquo;s ibuprofen. It&rsquo;s important to make sure you are giving your child the correct dosage for their age or weight.</li>
<li>Throat sprays may help ease sore throats, but they may not be suitable for younger children - speak to your local pharmacist about which ones that may be more suitable for your child.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to speak to your doctor if your child has tonsillitis</h2>
<p>If your child&rsquo;s symptoms remain after four days or your child becomes more unwell, you should see your GP. You should also see your doctor if your child has pus-filled spots on their tonsils.</p>
<p>Complications caused by&nbsp;<a href="https://patient.info/ears-nose-throat-mouth/sore-throat-2/tonsillitis">tonsillitis</a>&nbsp;are very rare but include the development of an abcess called a&nbsp;<a href="https://patient.info/ears-nose-throat-mouth/sore-throat-2/tonsillitis">quinsy</a>&nbsp;- a fluid-filled blister in the throat - which can make it difficult to breathe. It's important to see your doctor or go to A&amp;E if your child has difficulty breathing.</p>
<p>Most children get tonsillitis which is caused by a virus, but sometimes, it can be caused by bacteria. If this is the case, they may prescribe&nbsp;<a href="https://patient.info/infections/antibiotics-leaflet">antibiotics</a>. If your child is prescribed antibiotics, it's important that they finish the full course of the medication.</p>
